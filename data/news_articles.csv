Nestled in the bending of the river Tiskele, the sun increase concerning the agriculture city of Elodis, gone pursuing those surrounding Mt shadow.  Today, since they each day more than 250 years, the residents will increase to tend that the rich alluvial area country feeding for people of Kronos supplies. Two weeks in former days I received a e-mail of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis weekly day book, an agriculture document that the community serve round bending Tiskele. In its e-mail he described an once abundant area that now it is agitated by pollution, which solutions to a worsening problem wrestle to find.  I decided to examine. We did not make the connection firstly, Reese told me then I him on its office met.  The gas company built a couple had been year back in 94, and our problems had started not legal process.   After a couple harvests, we saw a fall in production.   We thought perhaps the only hiccup were, and improve the things would become.  Then the kids sick to be then started took we a harder can at what could changed be. The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company that by Sten Sanjorge Jr, business tycoon from Tethys in functioning are put. Established in 1961, the company GAStech started had as a family matter which grants the local exchanging services in Tethys.  The two founders - Hank Fluss and Sten Sanjorge Sr.- found more profitable unreliable drilling to be, and started this way with a range environment calamities and financial scandals which Sanjorge Sr. eventual in an early sepulchre in and Fluss in a marginal role in its own company.  With the death of Sanjorge SR, the zoon took the rudder firmly of GAStech in its seizure and broadened its influence further far gone, eventually landing at the threshold of the small peaceful municipality of Elodis. With a population of 6500, the most of residents of Elodis one imagine oneself themselves and two-story live on small agriculture companies.  A smaller number of families lives in the municipality along a street with two markets, two hardware rises, one gaspost and a café where you buy lunch, can take your mail and a liter buys milk to house to bring.  The families have lived in Elodis for generations. We have made a good for a long time living, Reese tell me. The population steadily have increased.  The production of the plant has been well.  Mainly, the young people have not left for the city since they have a lot in other rural places.  We have a lot country which could be still developed. There was a future here for them. I asked Reese me to help people meet it of who life has been influenced by the transactions of GAStech.  He introduced me to a farmer of whom family had been here for different generations. I obtained Henk Bodrogi which in city in purchases make at the hardware rise of Osvaldo to repair a broken motor tractor.  Bodrogi have soya broad beans complete life have been treated, such as its father and their fathers. I asked him concerning its life on the agriculture company.

The Wrap,"ELODIS, KRONOS   AID OF UNEXPECTED part two",1998-04-26,This Article is the second of  three,"This Article is the second advance of a three-part range the tackling growing problem of one fear of the community, government indictable offense, and the alarming influence of multinational companies on the country of Kronos. I met Henk Bodrogi which in city in purchases make rise of the hardware at Ferro to repair a broken motor tractor.  Bodrogi have soya broad beans complete life have been treated, such as its father and their fathers. I asked him concerning its life on the agriculture company. We the country has for a long time worked - perhaps 200 years, perhaps  more, Henk Bodrogi me since he picked concerning a container of, which bolt to the correct size.  In the course of the years we a couple has here and there added hectare.  I Busy is a understatement, since I found then I the wiry farmer to tell me more. I usually up to the areas by sun, M. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My woman takes care of the children heading to school, then they little something for us for lunch will turn to eat and beside me into diner to work.  When the children recover house of school they pass their jobs, and we are all at the house the most of times dark. We do this the most days, he adds, except worship days. Bodrogi identify the suitable bolt and chatter with the cashier concerning children and school since he are completes purchase. We all know each other it here, Bodrogi explain since we leave. The most of families have lived here for generations.  First new people who came to city were with that gas company built a couple year back. I ask Bodrogi if the matter has been well. We did to recently free good.  The profits were well and we add land, or promote material.  Then started we have all this problem with the plants. On which manner, I asked. The plants do not produce if they have in the past.  It took one while to calculate, then one of the town civil servants who are calculated to obtain a water specialist.  Then they tested it they said water was polluted. Bodrodgi which are sighed, and with a besieged can in its eye he me for my interest thanked and he told had lead me behind to house.  The motor tractor had be confirmed before they the next day could work.  I thanked him and paid attention to him climb in its truck and head from city. The water specialist appeared the international agency Wellness for all, an international agency with a task healthy bring water to communities to which by natural disasters it are agitated, drawing and - accidentally - oil and gas development. I obtained a representative of Wellness in for already next day.  Joclyn Reynolds are project coordinator for Wellness for all.  They spoke to me concerning a satellite question of its area office in South-East Asia where she was the efforts of the establishment aid after a earthquake. Ms. Reynolds came to me for a couple speak minutes between meetings concerning their work in Elodis. We were contacted by a town civil servant concerning a problem they with their room water had.  In the last years agriculture had collapsed, and the by-effect of certain sicknesses and birth shortages had increased.  The drinking water Elodis comes from the river Tiskele, like already water for agriculture, so that upstream we searched a source.  We found sources of the disposal of the production detritus upstream at the GAStech operation. The tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other things toxin. Are possible substances these natural? Not in these amounts, and not this sudden.  The pollution of the groundwater is usually the result of human activity.  GAStech release polluting substances of a pond.  The toxin to form subsurface plucks which trickles in the river Tiskele of which the residents of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for the plants to draw. You spoke to GAStech concerning this? Yes, she answered Oh.  We believed firstly we traction reached.  We met representatives GAStech, including one including the higher staff employees, several keren strict Fluss.  He insured our personal GAStech would act responsibly to assist material and financial to cleaning turn effort.  After a time, nevertheless, it became clear that whereas M. Fluss were serious the Sanjorge were those decisions take.  It is clear that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or environment. Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had its share in the company of its father in 1990, a reputation for cutthroat company practices had developed. Then we made no progress with GAStech, continuously Reynolds, the Community LEADERs decided for aid the government of Kronos to approach.   By our policy - and with authorization of the LEADERs Elodis - we published the test results in an officially public document.  The LEADERs Elodis approached then the government civil servants as citizens of a community Kronesian which is armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency insured them we again its available anyway would help then those agreements became gebeëindigd. On this point Ms. Reynolds as from the telephone were called, so that I returned my editor friend Pondo Reese to tell the tale to finishing.

His agent, Michale Kraft make several aspects in front of the court require that the contour of government that their detail charges, and Karel release.  Kraft had concluded an agreement with the government that expenses would be reduced and Karel is released while waiting for a test, but Karel died during two days before it was to go freely.

Requests of information were met insurances that the police force - whose Karel guard was inside per hour of its death - would make very possible to carry out a thorough research. This ""complete research"" lasted every two weeks, including time when it took the coroner of town of Abila to lose the original files of autopsy.  After the body of Karel was incinerated and sent to its family in Elodis, the chief of Abila police force closed the bag and refused to answer questions about the death of Karel declaring that ""we are satisfied death were normal causes and will not amuse any more of the investigations."" Several people close to research reported that the body of Karel showed signs of trauma blunted of force, abrasions and lacerations what were not formed with the cause of the death brought back by the police force.  These confidential sources since moved sector and were inalienable for the contact.

""Today we meet to point out Elian Karel to us,"" Silvia Marek said the enthusiastically, much which delayed the white candles in the honor of Karel. ""Elian was constant with a farm of Elodis not 40 minutes from here, in Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew with the spectrum of dead all around him.   Before Elian was 17 several of its members of family and the friends fought the constant disease, including its neighbor 10 years - old Juliana Vann. "" Marek made a pause one moment to allow the cries of ""remember Juliana!"" to fade. ""Elian devoted its life to the people of Elodis as well as all the citizens of Kronos, just as his/her father before him.  Elian knew that his would be a difficult voyage.  It had observed his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, walk of Henk Bodrogi the way even as it would go.  Elian knew that the course would not be easy, and would leave little time during a personal life.  However it chose to take these measurements in spite of the challenges which it knew that it would face."" The ""voyage of Elian finished three years ago of today.  But its dream did not die with him.  And it is this vision of healthy and future thrives for all we are here today to honor."" In afternoon several other loudspeakers paid homage not only to Elian, but all what were victims of the environmental catastrophe caused by avarice and corruption of the public civil servant. The gathering was disturbed only by the presence of aggravation of the police force of Abila in the speed of riot.  The police force agitated much crowd, involving them to have to leave the assembly rather than to be invaded with the sticks and the jet of pepper.","chief moving one wednesday ceremony guard group activist kronos poured homage fallen chief , elian karel , assassinated june 19 , 2009 illegally held prison kronos . `` today meet point elian karel u , '' silvia marek said enthusiastically , much delayed white candle honor karel . `` elian constant farm elodis 40 minute , jeroen antaura karel . grew spectrum dead around . elian 17 several member family friend fought constant disease , including neighbor 10 year - old juliana vann. `` marek made pause one moment allow cry `` remember juliana !

The Orb,MEMBERS OF POK STOPPED,2001-09-01,"ELODIS, Kronos","Heavies of government blocked the free speech - once again - members of the guards of group of activist of Kronos yesterday to a legal demonstration with the fields of curve of Tiskele.  The five activists of POK had met in front of the doors with the service of drilling of gas operations of GAStech to bring the public conscience about the polluted river of Tiskele which posed problems of health to the residents of Elodis. The spectators report that the demonstration had started peacefully with the five members of POK going in the two directions through the road, singing ""remember Juliana!"" and ""more poison!"" An eyewitness said that when the doors opened to make it possible vehicles of company of GAStech to leave the service the protesters moved on side.  The witnesses agree that at the same time the vehicles with the government of the joint of Kronos led to the doors, apparently projecting to write the service. ""It was all the very civil one upwards until then,"" Griffith Mabel, a resident of Elodis which had left to support the POK said.   ""The opened doors, the people of POK moved and the trucks drove out.  It is when it obtained strange.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for any reason."" Another eyewitness, farm Charley Normand of Elodis adds, ""ouais, the types of POK asked the drivers to move well, but the drivers of GAStech were unaware of them.  They had their windows downwards, thus it was not as they could not hear them."" The occupants of the vehicles of government left and joined the argument.  The sequence of operations becomes muddling in this moment.  Some witnesses state the arguments incited by drivers of GAStech with the protestateurs, and others think that the civils servant of government started to make to violence the protesters of the road. ""Proves to be the people in the cars of government were police force,"" Mabel says.  ""It carried uniforms and had badges."" The spectators say that the three parts started to howl, and at a certain point the police force of Kronos - probably of Abila- stopped the five activists and transported to a prison of Elodis.

The Orb,"ELODIS, KRONOS   HELP of an UNEXPECTED part two of SOURCE",1998-04-27,,"This article is the second installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos. I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the ferro store of material to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated the soil his whole life, just as his father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm. ""We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more,"" Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size.  ""During years we added a few hectares here and there.  It maintains occupied to us."" Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more. ""Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. ""My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner.  When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness."" ""We make these majority of the days,"" it is added, ""except days of worship."" Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase. ""All let us know We here another,"" Bodrogi explains while we leave. ""The majority of the families lived here for generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years."" I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good. ""We made very good until recently.  The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests."" How, I asked. ""Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city. The water specialist proved to be the international agency ""health for all"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas. I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for ""health for all"".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis. ""We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins."" ""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked him. ""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests."" ""You spoke in GAStech on this subject?"" ""OH yes,"" it answered.  ""In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Hank Fluss.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment."" Sten Sanjorge Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management. ""When we did not make progress with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. "" In this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

The Orb,"ELODIS, KRONOS   A CITY IN the NEED, part one",1998-03-20,"ELODIS, Kronos","This article is the first installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos. Nested in the curve of the river of Tiskele, the sun rises surplus the farm city of Elodis.  Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos. Two weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of Tiskele. In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the contamination, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration.  I decided to study. ""We did not draw up the report at the beginning,"" Reese said to me when I met him at his office.  ""The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately.   After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better.  Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed. "" The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of Tethys. Bench in 1961, the company of GAStech started like businesses had by family providing of the local services of haulage in Tethys.  The two founders - Hank Fluss and Sten Sanjorge Sr. - wild drilling found with being more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and scandals financial which ran thereafter  Sanjorge Sr. in a tomb early and led Fluss in a marginal role to its own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of Elodis. With a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of Elodis live in houses one and of two-history to small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house.  The families lived in Elodis for generations. ""We made for a long time a good life,"" Reese says to me. ""The population had firmly increased.  The vegetable production was good.  For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here."" I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations. I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of Osvaldo to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.

Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO. At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.","long day conflicting confusing information report still sketchy , story beginning come clear : kronos government source confirmed fourteen gastech international 's employee may kidnapped company 's headquarters abila . much speculation remains regarding taken kidnapping . speculation includes whether gastech international president ceo sten sanjorge jr. target given gastech international yet make statement press . speculation motivation behind kidnapping also rampant due recent gastech ipo . time one claimed responsibility kidnapping . edvard vann , gastech - kronos security guard interrogated released 6 hour , indicated protectors kronos suspected perpetrator behind today 's event . gastech international senior security executive site support investigation , aiding abila police department kronos government official . january 20th gastech 's annual corporate meeting . point company officer transitioning main office kronos government reception abduction took place . unconfirmed report fire office may served distraction kidnapper least contributed confusion event . abila fire department truck dispatched gastech - kronos headquarters around 10:00 morning local kronos time respond fire alarm .",MC1/News Articles/The World/49.txt,the-world,negative,neutral,"{""speculation"": 0.25457250982029456, ""gastech"": 0.2285267645249805, ""kidnapping"": 0.20440143163934407, ""kronos"": 0.19682740280598793, ""fire"": 0.1711584993165139, ""international"": 0.16907148732284868, ""may"": 0.16814650148676896, ""behind"": 0.16519658303181872, ""department"": 0.14665504974711907, ""security"": 0.13257911466909225, ""event"": 0.12714956452563522, ""distraction"": 0.11709027677069855, ""aiding"": 0.11297837639115556, ""rampant"": 0.11297837639115556, ""regarding"": 0.11297837639115556, ""sketchy"": 0.11297837639115556, ""headquarters"": 0.11271477260872693, ""abduction"": 0.10961870915378923, ""motivation"": 0.10961870915378923, ""transitioning"": 0.10961870915378923, ""report"": 0.10914018994230368, ""conflicting"": 0.10677815097876951, ""abila"": 0.10616452820387974, ""office"": 0.10394898699121992, ""dispatched"": 0.1021471415368799, ""perpetrator"": 0.1021471415368799, ""respond"": 0.1021471415368799, ""unconfirmed"": 0.1021471415368799, ""contributed"": 0.1002056471859532, ""served"": 0.1002056471859532, ""company"": 0.09916253097719062, ""confusing"": 0.09844935191233417, ""time"": 0.09777163737490831, ""senior"": 0.09684597994858686, ""government"": 0.09627723845738244, ""remains"": 0.09537102072111174, ""target"": 0.09537102072111174, ""whether"": 0.09537102072111174, ""includes"": 0.09400542177356715, ""interrogated"": 0.09400542177356715, ""kidnapper"": 0.09273407956904388, ""corporate"": 0.08837810736855972, ""confusion"": 0.08743291798075084, ""ipo"": 0.08653385415665782, ""story"": 0.08653385415665782, ""claimed"": 0.08332101760120787, ""least"": 0.08259829151590936, ""edvard"": 0.0819028447147682, ""suspected"": 0.0819028447147682, ""alarm"": 0.08123269256836477, ""kidnapped"": 0.07996135036384151, ""indicated"": 0.07935712727911903, ""main"": 0.07935712727911903, ""annual"": 0.07820505509022248, ""responsibility"": 0.0771207921888218, ""truck"": 0.0771207921888218, ""officer"": 0.07660168312647518, ""yet"": 0.07660168312647518, ""beginning"": 0.07560537816335734, ""fourteen"": 0.07332752487355954, ""statement"": 0.07332752487355954, ""january"": 0.07290389350192944, ""confirmed"": 0.0724897827469322, ""reception"": 0.0724897827469322, ""given"": 0.07054828839600549, ""support"": 0.07018338235137393, ""clear"": 0.069825562310707, ""due"": 0.069825562310707, ""point"": 0.06879199312238646, ""much"": 0.0684599633631624, ""investigation"": 0.06813381054644803, ""long"": 0.06813381054644803, ""recent"": 0.06658439807391665, ""source"": 0.06658439807391665, ""took"": 0.06658439807391665, ""taken"": 0.06628955733454613, ""information"": 0.06461320645131982, ""released"": 0.06408668054319669, ""executive"": 0.06307672077909618, ""press"": 0.06283264895815499, ""hour"": 0.062353994693797675, ""still"": 0.060988395746253074, ""make"": 0.06077032038353791, ""place"": 0.06077032038353791, ""local"": 0.06055479566835716, ""also"": 0.059922945662293434, ""come"": 0.059513436518777954, ""guard"": 0.059513436518777954, ""ceo"": 0.05931204486302678, ""site"": 0.05759220292094567, ""day"": 0.05723087461694916, ""vann"": 0.05723087461694916, ""morning"": 0.05670182910082551, ""protectors"": 0.05568723415796003, ""meeting"": 0.05504060103591454, ""around"": 0.05366365881126016, ""official"": 0.05279972779682379, ""jr"": 0.04911473036514373, ""sten"": 0.04854769630027477, ""today"": 0.047675242088145775, ""sanjorge"": 0.0473584350915247, ""employee"": 0.04653931565782442, ""president"": 0.04410376616150773, ""one"": 0.041338574770824935, ""police"": 0.03854122213279195}"

As wildcatters, they began drilling in areas not previously known to be gas fields. After many failed wells and on the brink of financial ruin, Fluss and Sanjorge, Sr. pressed on eventually finding one of the largest untapped gas fields in Tethys.

The World,UPGRADES NEEDED FOR ABILA'S DEEP WATER PORT,1993-09-19,"ABILA, Kronos","As part of the government brokered deal with GAStech International, Abila must make upgrades to their deep water port. When gas production ramps up, the Port's traffic is expected to increase ten-fold. The proposed upgrades include raising Abila's East Pier in phases, a massive $300 million project that will accommodate new, larger container ships. Currently the East Pier is roughly 3 meters above sea level and must be raised to 8 meters.

World Source,Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry,1982-10-02,,"The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.","world gas distant , difficult far flung . tethys year ago , journeyed laboriously remote gas field tethys look contentious new energy producing area . one site visited local office sanjorge gas company , crammed reinforced work boot overall chemical supply need run gas operation .

World Source,Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea,1984-05-03,,"<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> Continue reading the main story The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. ""Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,"" he told the Times. Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. ""GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.","< < deleted image : anti-offshore drilling protester . exploration proved controversial issue kronos > > continue reading main story son founder gas firm gastech planning venture drill mediterranean sea , times learned . belief large volume offshore gas could extracted . `` certainly offshore gas n't new concept , 's reason kronosian history offshore development ca n't develop resource offshore , '' told times . shale gas extracted using controversial technique hyper-acidic substrate removal involves injecting acidic chemical shale layer , break release natural gas trapped within . hyper-acidic substrate removal produced vast quantity gas oil west , transforming energy market . sanjorge say short time know offshore shale gas exploited . based existing geological data , sanjorge belief considerable quantity gas place - 100 trillion cubic foot , would gastech 's estimate onshore resource . gastech estimated kronos total offshore shale gas resource could five 10 time size resource available onshore . though recently become controversial , hyper-acidic substrate removal used smaller scale many year , improve flow conventional oil gas well . using process large number well needed extract offshore shale gas commercially never done . professor oskar wertz tethys university sceptical whether offshore shale gas could big contributor european energy next decade , say could potential longer term . `` gastech optimistic estimate long take explore offshore shale .

World Source,Multi-Country Task Force Formed,2013-10-22,,"Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team. ""These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,"" Loblaw stated in an interview. This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called ""Arise"". Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.""","interpol announced formation new multi-country task force combat increasingly wide distribution drug methyldimethyl cathinone ( mdmc ) . heading task force senior inspector robert loblaw , veteran officer led successful tethys counterdrug team . `` designer drug certain clue origin , '' loblaw stated interview . particular blend drug mdmc , also known street name `` cotton candy '' , `` spice dream '' `` tulip blossom '' , found previously asteria made way street tethys international country . asterian people 's army ( apa ) paramilitary organization engaged terrorist activity funded criminal enterprise , include drug trafficking . recent year apa sought build brand website publication professional , high-quality magazine called `` arise '' . senior inspector loblaw say tethys public statistic indicate mdmc growing problem country 's youth . `` increase mental health problem , including hallucination paranoia , accompanied violent behavior marked increase suicide rate indicator usage designer drug .

World Source,Profile   Elian Karel,2009-06-22,,"<<deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>> Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday. The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech.""","< < deleted image elian karel speaking rally abila > > voice protest , popularist demagogue others , protectors kronos leader elian karel became martyr rallying point ; figure disdain rabblerousing others , political concern kronosian government , within event filled year , accented suspicious death friday . leader forbearant environmental activist group , karel started brand politics , propelled pok spotlight island nation . fueled growing dissatisfaction heavy-handed kronosian government , started driving pok action-based organization , instead one waiting government make thing aright . resurrecting ember juliana vann campaign , 10 year old girl died illness attributed government-favored gastech corporation 's industrial waste stream 1998 , karel arrested thrown jail following pok-initiated human roadblock front gastech headquarters may . karel died wednesday serving time jail . rather charismatic , karel able inspire crowd draw attention pok social political agenda . likened pok terrorist group press interview , karel quipped , `` sanjorge brilliant leader gastech .

World Source,GAStech Profile,2013-02-22,,"It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech does more than just pump gas. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the ""state within a state"" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.","biggest

World Source,Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor,2012-06-20,,"Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos. The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who dies from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points. Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead. Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the ""gangs of criminals"" disrupting the peace.","traffic snarled around city abilians struggle get work amid vandalism looting early tuesday police stormed front presidential mansion capital building , breaking sit protectors kronos . conservative kronos government used emergency law threaten protestors arrest unless dispersed returned work . row environmental issue pok hold government gas giant gastech international responsible . signs among protester called government change social equality . images juliana vann , 10 year old girl dy illness attributed industrial giant gastech international served rallying point . tuesday third anniversary mysterious death elian karel , popular leader pok died prison . later day , largely peaceful demonstration turned violent crowd started vandalizing government building presidential homestead . police reinforcement sent area blocked road , skirmish police protestors broke . police used tear gas break unruly crowd . government spokesman complemented security force handling `` gang criminal '' disrupting peace .",MC1/News Articles/World Source/132.txt,world-source,negative,negative,"{""presidential"": 0.1890087418051086, ""giant"": 0.18051907378144624, ""government"": 0.16564964235770302, ""tuesday"": 0.1626374242392007, ""police"": 0.1591488853968781, ""protestors"": 0.15711386301895144, ""used"": 0.14966661004011575, ""crowd"": 0.14273004619311289, ""disrupting"": 0.12634823131608353, ""images"": 0.12634823131608353, ""signs"": 0.12634823131608353, ""unruly"": 0.12634823131608353, ""complemented"": 0.12087568846846221, ""handling"": 0.12087568846846221, ""homestead"": 0.12087568846846221, ""work"": 0.12083987480262755, ""dy"": 0.116630854456631, ""reinforcement"": 0.116630854456631, ""snarled"": 0.116630854456631, ""gang"": 0.11316257253312959, ""mysterious"": 0.11316257253312959, ""rallying"": 0.11316257253312959, ""unless"": 0.11316257253312959, ""vandalizing"": 0.11316257253312959, ""abilians"": 0.11023018194947226, ""equality"": 0.11023018194947226, ""looting"": 0.11023018194947226, ""row"": 0.11023018194947226, ""struggle"": 0.11023018194947226, ""threaten"": 0.11023018194947226, ""amid"": 0.10769002968550825, ""sit"": 0.10769002968550825, ""stormed"": 0.10769002968550825, ""largely"": 0.10544945659779696, ""skirmish"": 0.10544945659779696, ""building"": 0.10411502645382703, ""conservative"": 0.10344519567367708, ""served"": 0.10344519567367708, ""industrial"": 0.10163212112805661, ""mansion"": 0.10163212112805661, ""dispersed"": 0.09845427056407137, ""breaking"": 0.0970445231665183, ""attributed"": 0.0945043709025543, ""broke"": 0.0945043709025543, ""hold"": 0.0945043709025543, ""among"": 0.09226379781484301, ""popular"": 0.09226379781484301, ""third"": 0.09226379781484301, ""anniversary"": 0.09123528330738095, ""peace"": 0.08844646234510266, ""international"": 0.087268699819362, ""gas"": 0.08694212468908856, ""emergency"": 0.08601470287889194, ""illness"": 0.08601470287889194, ""issue"": 0.08601470287889194, ""later"": 0.08601470287889194, ""pok"": 0.08566315487757839, ""blocked"": 0.08526861178111741, ""vandalism"": 0.08455068187951038, ""road"": 0.08385886438356435, ""traffic"": 0.08319132625854285, ""social"": 0.0825464209553905, ""break"": 0.08192266394183935, ""get"": 0.08073334640977005, ""turned"": 0.08016545693868571, ""tear"": 0.07961403037173317, ""returned"": 0.07907813903188907, ""responsible"": 0.07855693150947572, ""early"": 0.0775554958457848, ""prison"": 0.0775554958457848, ""law"": 0.07614574844823173, ""started"": 0.07569813051289892, ""criminal"": 0.07441520281529665, ""girl"": 0.07441520281529665, ""peaceful"": 0.07321335786457439, ""change"": 0.07208295299816346, ""called"": 0.07101596955031754, ""point"": 0.07101596955031754, ""arrest"": 0.07000566747558891, ""sent"": 0.06968048204356912, ""capital"": 0.0690463271699411, ""front"": 0.06843263251289912, ""protester"": 0.06843263251289912, ""security"": 0.06843263251289912, ""demonstration"": 0.06615853891512744, ""juliana"": 0.06461529704315877, ""violent"": 0.06436983706283085, ""area"": 0.06388821932481521, ""old"": 0.06273496414390056, ""environmental"": 0.06102388922355278, ""city"": 0.060820433973594816, ""leader"": 0.060419937401313774, ""spokesman"": 0.05983457169148348, ""elian"": 0.059643385312984035, ""day"": 0.059081091630890474, ""vann"": 0.059081091630890474, ""gastech"": 0.058978701642158494, ""karel"": 0.058715255653446596, ""kronos"": 0.058054467470489896, ""protectors"": 0.05748754681765645, ""death"": 0.05715084980614043, ""died"": 0.0563342916367418, ""force"": 0.0563342916367418, ""around"": 0.05539855130115285, ""year"": 0.04146680142042438}"

Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell unrest in the capital Abila . Black smoke could be seen coming from the presidency compound in Abila. << Continue reading the main story >> A Protectors of Kronos spokesperson stated ""In Kronos the legacies of the environmental neglect and lack of concern for the people mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over"" Police used water to disperse the protesters who were throwing stones at the building. There were also reports of an attempted storming of the office. ""People protest because they are suffering, because they don't have medical help. We demand the government resign,"" Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told the Times. The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos. This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over. The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets. The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government. That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire. Kronos President  Dorel Kapelou II is quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership to address the ""terrorist threat to peace"" in the country.","journalist shawn

International Times,Kronos's Protectors of Kronos declared 'terrorist group',2009-02-22,,"<<Deleted image: POK has held numerous demonstrations in Kronos's capital of Abila>> Continue reading the main story The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week. Several of its supporters have been arrested in a crackdown. A POK leader vowed that protests would continue. Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau announced the move, which will give the authorities more power to crack down on the POK. He said that those who belonged to the group, financed it or promoted its activities would face punishment. Continue reading the main story The Protectors of Kronos Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization Founded in 1997. Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All Mixes political activism with environmental work Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles Slogan: ""Justice for Juliana"", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said. ""Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK,"" Mr. Drymiau said. ""This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence. ""It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism."" Kronos would notify Tethys who had signed a 1998 anti-terrorism treaty of the decision, he added. POK supporters The POK has denied being responsible for the attack, and accused the Kronos government of staging a frame-up to silence the groups concerns for the people. A POK member told the Times that the government's decision was ""illegitimate"". He added: ""The protests will continue, certainly.""","< < deleted image : pok held numerous demonstration kronos 's capital abila > > continue reading main story government kronos declared protectors kronos terrorist group blaming deadly attack police headquarters earlier week . several supporter arrested crackdown . pok leader vowed protest would continue . government spokesman rufus drymiau announced move , give authority power crack pok . said belonged group , financed promoted activity would face punishment . continue reading main story protectors kronos kronos 's oldest largest environmental activist organization founded 1997 . influenced international group wellness mixes political activism environmental work rejects use violence support democratic principle slogan : `` justice juliana '' , reference 10-year old kronosian girl died result government sponsored environmental contamination decision response tuesday 's bombing police headquarters abila , said . `` kronos horrified north south hideous crime committed pok , '' mr. drymiau said . `` context dangerous escalation violence kronos kronosians clear declaration pok know nothing violence . `` 's possible kronos state kronos people submit pok terrorism .

International Times,Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry,1982-10-02,,"The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources. ""Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings"" When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.","world gas distant , difficult far flung . tethys year ago , journeyed laboriously remote gas field tethys look contentious new energy producing area . one site visited local office sanjorge gas company , crammed reinforced work boot overall chemical supply need run gas operation . remember , former trucker charge . vivid example small exploration company thethys begun grow mighty international force energy industry .

International Times,"Kronos' oil and gas industry has warned it faces its ""biggest challenge in 20 years"" due to the low levels of exploration.",2012-02-20,,"Government energy officials said only 15 wells were drilled last year. That was despite strong levels of investment, reaching a record last year and sustained this year. Exploration drilling was down from 26 wells six years ago, only sufficient to recover a fraction of the estimated oil and gas remaining in the countries oil and gas fields. ""Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around"" -Energy Minister Jules Jecovic The annual activity survey by Oil and Gas Kronos found a rapid increase in production costs, up by 15% last year. The average cost of extracting a barrel of oil was up by 27% in only a year, to reach K17. The number of fields with cost per barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months. Rising costs were cited last week by GAStech, which is considering future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos fields. With rising costs, production tax payments to the Kronos Treasury are expected to fall from K3.5bn during the 2011-12 financial year to K2bn in the current year. Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

International Times,GASTech Employees Kidnapped in Kronos,,,"Fourteen employees feared kidnapped in Kronos by a radical environmental terrorist group during a corporate gathering. Fourteen employees, including possibly five executive officers, are feared kidnapped yesterday by the ""Protectors of Kronos"".  Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais. Local news organizations have received a ransom note from the POK claiming responsibility and demanding $20 Million from the company.  It is possible additional demands are forthcoming. Sanjorge and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters.  A fire alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that.  The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released. John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. ""However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk."" The Times's correspondent in Abila says GASTech offices are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.

International Times,Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea,1984-05-03,,"<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> Continue reading the main story The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon. ""Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,"" he told the Times. Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities. Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. ""We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,"" SanJorge said. ""Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer."" Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. ""GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.""","< < deleted image : anti-offshore drilling protester . exploration proved controversial issue kronos > > continue reading main story son founder gas firm gastech planning venture drill mediterranean sea , times learned . sten sanjorge , jr. belief large volume offshore gas could extracted . sanjorge gastech awarded three licence kronos government last month ministry energy development hope begin exploration soon . `` certainly offshore gas n't new concept , 's reason kronosian history offshore development ca n't develop resource offshore , '' told times . shale gas extracted using controversial technique hyper-acidic substrate removal involves injecting acidic chemical shale layer , break release natural gas trapped within . hyper-acidic substrate removal produced vast quantity gas oil west , transforming energy market . project europe slow take , beset opposition government local community . sanjorge say short time know offshore shale gas exploited . many environmentalist believe hyper-acidic substrate removal damage marine environment , oppose extraction new fossil fuel resource . drilling offshore avoids need difficult negotiation local council , community landholder . based existing geological data , sanjorge belief considerable quantity gas place - 100 trillion cubic foot , would gastech 's estimate onshore resource . also possibility finding oil . gastech estimated kronos total offshore shale gas resource could five 10 time size resource available onshore . `` 're comfortable resource number absolutely ginormous , '' sanjorge said . `` exploitable ?

A Kronos disaster victim identification team was sent to examine the wreckage. Assistant Police Commissioner Adian Koppolis described the scene as ""horrific"". He said the nine-year old boy was found wandering around the accident site. ""It's tragic that no one ultimately survived.

International Times,GAStech,2013-02-22,,"It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region. It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the ""state within a state"" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. Of course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre. In addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will. It hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their ""non-core activities"". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.","biggest company kronos , third largest gas company planet , fifty-three year old . past reputation corrupt environmentally harmful , nowadays gastech , former tethys-only business , trying earn trust international investor . form part ambition expand profitable business supplying gas outside mediterranean region . uphill task , certainty gastech ability convince potential investor mended way , longer rooted eco-hostile past . gastech 's pipeline operation based eastern kronos , close relationship kronosian government . heart kronos 's pipeline business , gas eastern gas field piped west towards rest kronos , tethys europe . gastech pump gas . created town city service operation , manages run almost single-handed . head gastech , sten sanjorge , jr , whose photo stare calendar picture frame everywhere country , acknowledges `` state within state '' accusation , argues company simply need look worker community around . course , people need good reason come work hostile remote kronosian region . provided medical care , entertainment , food . gastech empire owns 2 thousand cow 3 thousand pig company farm , run gym , offer subsidised holiday black sea resort key employee . executive , run state art , marble-lined medical therapy centre . addition perk , also gastech tv station , n't even pretend unbiased .

International Times,Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users,2013-02-07,,"The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as ""cotton candy"" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. ""We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month,"" said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. ""We are literally overwhelmed."" Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse. Authorities in Abila said ""cotton candy"" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to ""Cotton Candy"" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said. Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. ""We went from zero calls to a handful of calls"" in the last month,"" he said. Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken. ""You don't know what you're getting when you get it,"" Bianca said. ""We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana."" Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. ""There are no controlled studies in toxicology,"" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. ""It is another way to sell it,"" she said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of ""Spice Dreams"" one week and under the name of ""Tulip Blossom"" the next. The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as ""herbal therapy"" products and are available over the counter in area stores. ""We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,"" Bianca said. One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. ""They crave it,"" she said. After repeated use, the drug ""fries"" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. ""The seizures and delusions are incredible,"" she said. While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.","emergency department abila general hospital kronos swamped last month people suffering medical complication designer drug `` cotton candy '' synthetic marijuana , hospital official said . `` least two dozen case last month , '' said alicia bianca , nurse manager department . `` literally overwhelmed .

International Times,Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor,2012-06-20,,"Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos. Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day. The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points. People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired. Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead. A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the ""gangs of criminals"" disrupting the peace.","traffic snarled around city abilians struggle get work amid vandalism

International Times,Global disasters drain charity coffers,1999-11-14,,"New appeals campaigns on the horizon to maintain liquidity. Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs. The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of ""food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods."" One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  ""We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find,"" stated Dr. Mahmed. ""So much is needed but so much has already been spent."" Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey. Yet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  ""The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated,"" stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  ""We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home.""  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid. The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so. Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times ""I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there.""","new appeal campaign horizon maintain liquidity . aid agency warned monetary food need increased worldwide may able meet basic need . un office coordination humanitarian affairs say 15 million people remain need vital good service , number severity crisis resulted lack `` food , healthcare , access livelihood .

International Times,Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force,2013-10-21,,"Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team.  He is optimistic that he can identify the source. ""These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,"" Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  ""Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree."" This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. ""I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army,"" Loblaw said.  ""Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation."" The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called ""Arise"". Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."" ""As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC.""","interpol announced formation new multi-country task force combat increasingly wide distribution drug methyldimethyl cathinone ( mdmc ) . heading task force senior inspector robert loblaw , veteran officer led successful tethys counterdrug team . optimistic identify source . `` designer drug certain clue origin , '' loblaw told times interview . `` every time recipe changed , leaf clue made .

International Times,Profile   Elian Karel,2009-06-22,,"<<deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>> Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday. The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death. Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high.""

Athena Speaks,WHO ARE the PROTESTERS,2012-08-24,"ABILA, Kronos","With the approaching third birthday of the death of of Elian Karel - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only which is they, which and why they protest? The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of Wellness for All(WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since. The second principal martyr of POK is Elian Karel, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. The POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK as ""threatens public"".","approaching third birthday death elian karel - former member protectors kronos - question : protester ? , protest ?

Nestled in the curve of the river of Tiskele, the sun rises excessive the city that cultivates of Elodis.  Today, as they have by more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tend to the rich Earth of floodplain that provides the food for the people of Kronos. Two weeks I previously received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of the agriculture that served to the community around the curve of Tiskele. In his email it described once generous region now caused sorrow by the contamination, fighting to find solutions to a worsening problem.  He decided to investigate. ""We did not make the connection at the outset,"" Reese we said to me when I sat with him in its office.  ""The company of the gas had been part of some years constructed in '94, and our problems did not begin immediately.  After a pair of harvests, we saw a declination in the production.   We think that perhaps hiccup was right, and the things would obtain better.  Then when obtaining begun the ill we done one more a glance harder what could have changed. "" The change turned out to be international GAStech, an international corporation directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, tycoon of the business outside Tethys. Established in 1961, the corporation of GAStech began like had business family who provided services that carried the premises in Tethys.  Both founders - Mr. hank Fluss and Sten Sanjorge - perforating savage found to being more lucrative, and began therefore a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that worked Mr.  Sanjorge in an early tomb and lead possible Fluss in a marginal seatin their own company.  With the death of Mr.  Sanjorge, the son took the rudder from GAStech firmly in his grasping and widened his influence more far to the distant spot, possible landing in the threshold of small the  municipality of Elodis. With a population of 6500, most of the residents of Elodis they live in houses and on two-history in small farms.  A smaller number of families lives in the municipality throughout a main street with two markets, two warehouses of the hardware, a powerboat and a coffee where you can buy lunch, take his mail and buy a liter of milk to bring the home.  The families have lived in Elodis for the generations. ""We have made a good life during long time,"" Reese we say to me. ""The population has been increasing constantly.  The vegetal production has been good.  For most, the young people have not gone away for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have many of earth that could still be developed. There was a future for them here."" I requested Reese to help me to meet the people who lives have been affected by the operations of GAStech.  It introduced a farmer to he who family had here been for several generations. I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Osvaldo to repair an broken tractor.

Pondo Reese, editor of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, is stopped in its window, watching towards outside towards the sun that fixes to the river of Tiskele.  I have requested that he says to me on the implication of the government of Kronos in the deeply worrisome account of the fight of a community for the protection against which they must help them more: its chosen civil employees, against whom they would poison his children and the food of the country. ""It took from long term so that any person responds,"" Reese says to me of its fight.  ""Henk Bodrogi - the man who you talked to - did not give for above.  It called each department that could possibly be associated to our problem:  outer interior, justice, subjects, health.Henk and some other residents made several trips to Abila that tried to be able somebody to listen. Finally, a comprehensive person of the ministry of the health answered the door, so that is where we began. "" Then Reese describes months of the meetings in which the officials of the government demanded the documents that proved their case:  statistic of the health and the harvest, the scientific test resultses of the health for all, and medical files. ""It has been frustrating.  We bring the documents, and then they wish to confirm the results, or they say to us to provide the additional information or to have closed meetings.

Daily Pegasus,"ELODIS, KRONOS   AID of one divides two of the SOURCE UNEXPECTED",1998-04-27,,"This article is the second installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the government, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos. I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm. ""We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more,"" Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  ""On the years we have added some hectares here and there.  To us it maintains occupied."" Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more. ""My wife obtains the raising of children and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper.  When the children get school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all in the house most of the times by darkness."" ""We do this most of the days,"" he we added, ""with the exception of days of the adoration."" ""All we know one another one here,"" Bodrogi we explained whereas we go away. ""Most of the families they have lived here for the generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the back part of some years."" I request Bodrogi if the business has been good. ""We made quite good recently until time.  The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests."" How, I it requested. ""The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.I th anked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city. The specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency ""health for all"", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas. I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the ""health for all"".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevation of the creation which followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis. ""A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. "" ""These substances Can happen naturally"" I asked to him. ""Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable water and irrigation for the harvests."" ""You spoke with GAStech on this?"" ""Oh yes,"" she answered.  ""We thought at the outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of ""the senior"" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere."" Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat. ""When we did not make progress with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded.

Daily Pegasus,THE MEMBERS OF POK ARRESTED,2001-09-02,"ELODIS, Kronos","Heavies of the government obstructed the free speech - yet again - of the members of the protectors of the group of the activist of Kronos yesterday in a legal demonstration in the fields of the curve of Tiskele.  The five activists of POK had collected in front of the doors to the facility of the operations of the gas of GAStech that he perforated to cause to public conscience the contaminated river of Tiskele that has caused problems of health to the residents of Elodis. The present people disclose that the demonstration had begun Pacific with the five members of POK that walked forwards and backwards through way, singing ""remembers Julian"" and ""not more of poison"". An eyewitness said that when the doors were opened to allow that the vehicles of the company of GAStech leave the facility the moved demonstrators to a side.  The witnesses apparently agree that at the same time the vehicles with the government of the seal of Kronos lead to the doors, gliding to incorporate the facility. ""Era all the very civil one for above until then,"" Griffith Mabel, resident of Elodis that had left to support the POK said.   ""The opened doors, the POK people moved and the cars expelled.  That one is when stranger obtained.  The cars stopped in means of the way for no reason."" Another eyewitness, farmer Charley Normand de Elodis adds, ""Yes, the POK individuals requested that the conductors moved pleasant, but the conductors of GAStech did not pay attention to them.  They had his windows down, so he was not as they could not hear them."" The renters of the vehicles of the government left and assembled of altercation.  The event sequence gets to be confused at this point.  Some witnesses indicate the instigadas discussions the conductors of GAStech with protestors, and others think that the officials of the government began to intimidate the demonstrators of the way. ""It is to people in the cars of the government were police,"" Mabel says.  ""He used the uniforms and had currencies."" Onlookers says that the three parties began to shout, and in a certain point the police of Kronos - of Abila- it arrested five activists it probably transported and them to a jail of Elodis. In spite of the repeated orders an interview, has not granted the access those arrested.","heavies government obstructed free speech - yet - member protector group activist kronos yesterday legal demonstration field curve tiskele . five activist pok collected front door facility operation gas gastech perforated cause public conscience contaminated river tiskele caused problem health resident elodis . present people disclose demonstration begun pacific five member pok walked forward backwards way , singing `` remembers julian '' `` poison '' . eyewitness said door opened allow vehicle company gastech leave facility moved demonstrator side . witness apparently agree time vehicle government seal kronos lead door , gliding incorporate facility . `` era civil one , '' griffith mabel , resident elodis left support pok said . `` opened door , pok people moved car expelled . one stranger obtained . car stopped mean way reason .

Homeland Illumination,POK MEMBERS ARRESTED,2001-08-31,"ELODIS, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis. Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting ""Remember Juliana!"" and ""No more poison!"" An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. ""It was all very civil up till then,"" Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   ""The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."" Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, ""Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them."" The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road. ""Turns out the people in the government cars were police,"" Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  ""They wore uniforms and had badges."" Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail. Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.","author : petrus gerhard government heavy obstructed free speech - yet - member activist group protectors kronos yesterday lawful demonstration tiskele bend field . five pok activist gathered front gate gastech gas drilling operation facility bring public awareness polluted tiskele river caused health problem resident elodis . bystanders report demonstration begun peacefully five pok member walking back forth across road , chanting `` remember juliana !

Homeland Illumination,"ELODIS, KRONOS   HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two",1998-04-25,,"AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm. ""We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,"" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  ""Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy."" Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. ""I usually head to the fields before sun up,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. ""My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark."" ""We do this most days,"" he adds, ""except for worship days."" Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase. ""We all know one another here,"" Bodrogi explains as we leave. ""Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back."" I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. ""We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops."" In what way, I asked. ""The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The water specialist turned out to be the international agency ""Wellness For All"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for ""Wellness for All"".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis. ""We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. "" ""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked her. ""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."" ""Did you talk to GAStech about this?"" ""Oh yes,"" she replied.  ""At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment."" Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices. ""When we didn't make headway with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized."" At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

Homeland Illumination,"IN REMEMBRANCE   THE DEATH OF ELIAN KAREL, A YEAR LATER",2010-06-19,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard One year ago today a young man in search of a brighter future for his countrymen died in a cold, cement prison.  He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death. The report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. In the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources.

Homeland Illumination,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.” As reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel’s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. “Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,” one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  “Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?” Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  “Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!”","author : petrus gerhard two year ago yesterday elian karel died age 28 abila jail cell , purportedly cardiac arrest . arrested three month prior spurious charge tax evasion left

Homeland Illumination,"ELODIS, KRONOS   A TOWN IN NEED, Part One",1998-03-19,,"AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate. ""We didn't make the connection at first,"" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  ""The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed."" The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. ""We've made a good living for a long time,"" Reese tells me. ""The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here."" I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations. I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

Homeland Illumination,POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS,2009-03-07,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading ""Remember Juliana!"" and chanting ""We want truth!"" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993. Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other. ""We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living,"" said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  ""All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!"" The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems. ""The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers,"" accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  ""What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies. Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability. ""We aren't asking for anything unreasonable,"" Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  ""All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting."" Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.","author : petrus gerhard thousands protester carrying banner reading `` remember juliana ! '' chanting `` want truth !

Homeland Illumination,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This ""thorough investigation"" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that ""we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. ""Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,"" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ""Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?"" Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  ""Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!""","author : petrus gerhard two year ago yesterday elian karel died age 28 abila jail cell , purportedly cardiac arrest . arrested three month prior spurious charge tax evasion left linger jail cell without legal action . attorney , michale kraft made several appearance court demanding government outline specific charge , release karel . kraft reached agreement government charge would reduced karel released pending trial , karel died two day go free . questions linger , however , manner karel 's death . requests information met assurance police -whose custody karel time death - would everything possible perform exhaustive investigation . `` thorough investigation '' lasted two week , including time took abila city coroner lose original autopsy file . karel 's body cremated sent family elodis , abila chief police closed case declined answer question karel 's death stating `` satisfied death natural cause longer entertaining inquiry .

Homeland Illumination,POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED,2009-03-12,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township west of Abila. Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, ""I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday."" Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. ""We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community,"" Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  ""We didn't ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?"" The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel. ""He's a determined man,"" Karel's attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. ""He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He'll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally."" Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning. Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.","author : petrus gerhard another unconscionable move citizen kronos , earlier today police arrested pok leader elian karel spurious tax evasion charge . led - manacled - meeting protectors kronos elodis , rural township west abila . demonstrating trademark humor , karel lifted wrist joked supporter led away , `` guess n't sent president case bottled water birthday .

Homeland Illumination,POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED,2009-03-12,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled – from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila. Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, “I guess I shouldn’t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.” Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. “We didn’t ask for GAStech to come to our community,” Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  “We didn’t’ ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?” The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel. “He’s a determined man,” Karel’s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. “He’ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He’ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.” Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning. Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.","author : petrus gerhard another unconscionable move citizen kronos , earlier today police arrested pok leader elian karel spurious tax evasion charge . led - manacled – meeting protectors kronos elodis , rural township outside abila . demonstrating trademark humor , karel lifted wrist joked supporter led away , “ guess ’ sent president case bottled water birthday. ” karel leader protectors kronos , alliance kronos citizen elodis demanded government clean contaminated water caused gas drilling community . “ ’ ask gastech come community , ” karel spoke rally month ago . “ ’ ’ ask water become undrinkable , child become sick . neither elodis people kronos received benefit extraordinarily large amount money gastech clear every year . ask : money going ?

Homeland Illumination,"ELODIS, KRONOS  WILL THE GOVERNMENT RESPOND IN TIME? Part Three",1998-05-15,,"AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. Pondo Reese, editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the Tiskele River.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. ""It took a long time for anyone to respond,"" Reese tells me of their struggle.  ""Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started."" Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records. ""It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance."" Has it been worth it?

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.   ""We're trying to get the attention of our government,"" he told the Homeland Illumination.  ""This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event."" He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies. ""They need to be aware that we know what they're doing,"" added Vardshvna.  ""You can't just steal our money and think you can get away with it."" Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.

Homeland Illumination,TEN-YEAR OLD ELODIS GIRL DIES OF POISONING,1998-08-19,,"AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Earlier this year a series Homeland Illumination published a series of articles about groundwater contamination in Elodis, and how the locals are demanding a government response for what is essentially Government of Kronos-sponsored pollution and poisoning of citizens.  This article is an update. ELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning. Juliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover. The residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis. Juliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech. Private funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.","author : petrus gerhard earlier year series homeland illumination published series article groundwater contamination elodis , local demanding government response essentially government kronos-sponsored pollution poisoning citizen . article update . elodis , kronos - ten-year old juliana vann died yesterday afternoon , surrounded family friend . cause death leukemia due benzene poisoning . juliana sick year . initially family n't realize benzene poisoning cause juliana 's problem . visit many hospital , doctor associated international assistance organization wellness recommended juliana test benzene poisoning . point , however , little girl 's system damaged recover . resident elodis pleading government kronos take action pollution caused gastech gas drilling operation 20 km upstream elodis . juliana 's death one several death rural township suffered toxic waste dumped tiskele river tethys corporation gastech . private funeral service held august 21 family home .",MC1/News Articles/Homeland Illumination/293.txt,homeland-illumination,negative,negative,"{""poisoning"": 0.3423827286734076, ""juliana"": 0.3126631796385302, ""benzene"": 0.22240521302218866, ""family"": 0.18905139255378126, ""elodis"": 0.1832318879814335, ""series"": 0.1747006364644895, ""article"": 0.17290420754596902, ""death"": 0.16592634162925832, ""pollution"": 0.15106790428960493, ""cause"": 0.13425029326105678, ""essentially"": 0.12974032161534674, ""funeral"": 0.12227581254824171, ""year"": 0.12039076727812188, ""august"": 0.11287164330146741, ""dumped"": 0.11287164330146741, ""pleading"": 0.11287164330146741, ""recommended"": 0.10951515001363038, ""visit"": 0.10951515001363038, ""realize"": 0.10667727537470087, ""damaged"": 0.10205064094652536, ""leukemia"": 0.1001109807668561, ""groundwater"": 0.09675448747901903, ""km"": 0.09675448747901903, ""recover"": 0.09675448747901903, ""government"": 0.09618628329007128, ""sponsored"": 0.0952809216770873, ""sick"": 0.09391661284008954, ""associated"": 0.09264647169975107, ""initially"": 0.09264647169975107, ""surrounded"": 0.09264647169975107, ""doctor"": 0.09145833401151272, ""system"": 0.09145833401151272, ""toxic"": 0.09145833401151272, ""afternoon"": 0.09034225020999885, ""waste"": 0.09034225020999885, ""assistance"": 0.08928997841191402, ""illumination"": 0.0882946146794138, ""upstream"": 0.08735031823224475, ""demanding"": 0.08645210377298451, ""township"": 0.08645210377298451, ""homeland"": 0.0855956821683519, ""kronos"": 0.08427490960579034, ""friend"": 0.081825469344809, ""petrus"": 0.081825469344809, ""gerhard"": 0.08050992807157975, ""service"": 0.08050992807157975, ""suffered"": 0.08050992807157975, ""home"": 0.07988580916513972, ""private"": 0.07928215690289456, ""corporation"": 0.07652931587730269, ""earlier"": 0.07652931587730269, ""published"": 0.07652931587730269, ""river"": 0.07602490776137179, ""test"": 0.07553395214480246, ""response"": 0.07413507100739622, ""girl"": 0.07201667403969682, ""wellness"": 0.07162075029518541, ""problem"": 0.07085356659944365, ""little"": 0.0701170786082825, ""due"": 0.06975959660786461, ""point"": 0.0687270038544726, ""ten"": 0.06806944307769745, ""resident"": 0.06712514663052839, ""held"": 0.06682084640389874, ""take"": 0.0665214943682832, ""rural"": 0.06593700894229003, ""action"": 0.06537051056663555, ""operation"": 0.06509366708567274, ""drilling"": 0.06402613648476067, ""many"": 0.06351472180564068, ""organization"": 0.06351472180564068, ""hospital"": 0.06301713085126041, ""caused"": 0.06182899316302207, ""contamination"": 0.06137440847278487, ""old"": 0.0607129093615082, ""local"": 0.060497588257137684, ""however"": 0.05905698530117819, ""citizen"": 0.05886008776057409, ""vann"": 0.057176807385072206, ""gastech"": 0.057077717600129446, ""yesterday"": 0.055308780543086106, ""update"": 0.05498860300235707, ""died"": 0.05451854143474164, ""several"": 0.054060183869287404, ""tiskele"": 0.054060183869287404, ""author"": 0.0528909182939853, ""tethys"": 0.05037961087985098, ""international"": 0.04222794046774572, ""gas"": 0.042069915939043245, ""one"": 0.04129952133467607}"

Homeland Illumination,POK REMEMBERS MARTYRED LEADER,2012-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail. ""Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,"" Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor. ""Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."" Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of ""Remember Juliana!"" to fade. ""Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."" ""Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor."" Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.","author : petrus gerhard touching ceremony wednesday leader activist group protectors kronos paid tribute fallen leader , elian karel , murdered 19 june 2009 illegally detained kronos jail . `` today gather remember elian karel , '' silvia marek told rapt assembly , many held white candle karel 's honor . `` elian born elodis farm 40 minute , jeroen antaura karel . grew specter death around . time elian 17 many family member friend battling constant illness , including neighbor 10-year old juliana vann .

Homeland Illumination,WHO BRINGS A GUN TO A SIT IN?,2013-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds. On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water. Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad? Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles. How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?","author : petrus gerhard yesterday , june 19th past

Kronos Star,Kronos Benefits from Foreign Investment,1998-01-18,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Lelio Masin Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it. However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign ""experts"" who claim to ""have our best interests at heart"" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.","author : lelio masin today fifth anniversary president araullo 's visionary plan bring foreign investment kronos , bold act reaped tremendous benefit fair country . today 's abila bustling metropolis full new car , new construction , gleaming office building , modern convenience . gone potholed street , run-down factory , tired storefront , sad marketplace past . today 's abila city industry , place commerce investment , place opportunity success . prosperity come kronos , better . however , still wrongly think prosperity bad u . people claim foreign investment bad country , diluting culture undermining value . claim foreigner exploiting u gain government little regard welfare people . militant wrong-headed belief fabricated claim foreign company poisoning child technology . even gone far brought foreign `` expert '' claim `` best interest heart '' help spread agenda progress prosperity people . hypocrisy bringing foreigner tell u opening country foreigner bad u ludicrous obviously sign mental illness oppose modernization .",MC1/News Articles/Kronos Star/38.txt,kronos-star,positive,neutral,"{""prosperity"": 0.2833363778256105, ""foreigner"": 0.261616045609701, ""bad"": 0.2513038867990114, ""claim"": 0.24965187299441757, ""foreign"": 0.19381161632623037, ""investment"": 0.17087152165162664, ""country"": 0.13883903062502753, ""gone"": 0.13581464352467404, ""today"": 0.11956385670162448, ""bustling"": 0.10856034255429972, ""down"": 0.10856034255429972, ""exploiting"": 0.10856034255429972, ""fabricated"": 0.10856034255429972, ""marketplace"": 0.10856034255429972, ""wrongly"": 0.10856034255429972, ""people"": 0.1034832351270324, ""bold"": 0.1023144072025506, ""convenience"": 0.1023144072025506, ""reaped"": 0.1023144072025506, ""tremendous"": 0.1023144072025506, ""undermining"": 0.1023144072025506, ""place"": 0.10160317402780113, ""commerce"": 0.09788284554543336, ""diluting"": 0.09788284554543336, ""lelio"": 0.09788284554543336, ""ludicrous"": 0.09788284554543336, ""masin"": 0.09788284554543336, ""obviously"": 0.09788284554543336, ""storefront"": 0.09788284554543336, ""factory"": 0.0944454592752035, ""hypocrisy"": 0.0944454592752035, ""metropolis"": 0.0944454592752035, ""militant"": 0.0944454592752035, ""potholed"": 0.0944454592752035, ""sad"": 0.0944454592752035, ""tired"": 0.0944454592752035, ""wrong"": 0.0944454592752035, ""new"": 0.09338096894643727, ""fair"": 0.09163691019368422, ""fifth"": 0.09163691019368422, ""gleaming"": 0.09163691019368422, ""opportunity"": 0.09163691019368422, ""welfare"": 0.09163691019368422, ""headed"": 0.08926231578006975, ""belief"": 0.087205348536567, ""agenda"": 0.08539097484193509, ""bringing"": 0.08539097484193509, ""culture"": 0.08539097484193509, ""visionary"": 0.08539097484193509, ""oppose"": 0.08376796226633713, ""progress"": 0.08376796226633713, ""regard"": 0.08376796226633713, ""technology"": 0.08376796226633713, ""mental"": 0.08229976880278861, ""modernization"": 0.08229976880278861, ""best"": 0.08095941318481785, ""spread"": 0.08095941318481785, ""success"": 0.07972640554122427, ""opening"": 0.07858481877120338, ""modern"": 0.077522026914588, ""better"": 0.07559396730186317, ""value"": 0.07559396730186317, ""anniversary"": 0.07388060624449105, ""benefit"": 0.07388060624449105, ""gain"": 0.07388060624449105, ""expert"": 0.07309046525747076, ""interest"": 0.07309046525747076, ""poisoning"": 0.07162227179392223, ""full"": 0.07093752030794563, ""run"": 0.07093752030794563, ""tell"": 0.07028191617595149, ""illness"": 0.06965307898724091, ""even"": 0.06846754248131957, ""act"": 0.06736676201856177, ""past"": 0.0649164702929968, ""industry"": 0.06446993549210715, ""think"": 0.06403598082420235, ""far"": 0.06361391683383415, ""heart"": 0.06241296824860439, ""plan"": 0.061661386410587875, ""street"": 0.061661386410587875, ""car"": 0.06129891387551745, ""brought"": 0.06094477478505587, ""child"": 0.06026002329907927, ""araullo"": 0.059928733713895635, ""abila"": 0.05916623425492748, ""little"": 0.05867053494124766, ""construction"": 0.05837141152349153, ""help"": 0.05566192626880706, ""sign"": 0.05293641982496777, ""still"": 0.0509838894017215, ""bring"": 0.05062141686665107, ""come"": 0.049750881758127925, ""however"": 0.04941599091705793, ""city"": 0.049251236705029275, ""kronos"": 0.04701140936309111, ""author"": 0.0442565282443953, ""office"": 0.043448623228517544, ""building"": 0.0421551892794291, ""company"": 0.04144797916287603, ""president"": 0.03686900612262527, ""government"": 0.026827989255731606}"

Kronos Star,Minister of Health Dies Suddenly,2001-06-14,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Eva Thayer It is with great sorrow that we announce the death of Minister of Health Cesare Nespola.  Minister Nespola, 62, died peacefully in his sleep yesterday of a suspected heart attack.  A tireless champion for the welfare of our people, Nespola was a physician who had been picked to lead the Ministry of Health in 1995 by former president Araullo.

Kronos Star,POK Anniversary Rally Ends in Riot,2012-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani POK members held a large demonstration in Abila yesterday.  Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and ""the rich get richer on the backs of the poor"".  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, ""We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."" The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, ""We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now.

Kronos Star,Protestors Block Traffic to Tiskele Bend Fields,2005-04-06,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence. ""We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives,"" government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.","author : marcella trapani dozen pok protester handcuffed taken custody police tuesday blocking access tiskele bend field . police made arrest shortly 9 a.m. , protester told breaking law trespassing government property , blocking access government-owned land , impeding lawful commercial traffic . protester arrived entrance tiskele bend site 5:30 a.m. locked arm across road three hour , despite asked leave police . traffic road began back , several truck driver began leave vehicle congregate near protester . tempers began flare blockade persisted second hour , driver started shouting cursing protester move road . police officer quickly moved arrested pok protester situation could escalate violence . `` appreciate citizen voicing opinion , middle busy road right forum discussion national environmental policy . encourage concerned citizen follow democratic process contact assembly representative , '' government spokesman rufus drymiau said statement .",MC1/News Articles/Kronos Star/781.txt,kronos-star,negative,neutral,"{""protester"": 0.368187246325448, ""road"": 0.3007898739103635, ""began"": 0.21565660823520427, ""blocking"": 0.1891161357068424, ""access"": 0.15163566266083164, ""traffic"": 0.1491977545825635, ""driver"": 0.14377107215680285, ""police"": 0.14271112995445018, ""leave"": 0.13345839844340987, ""bend"": 0.13200642626220827, ""voicing"": 0.12021476808810135, ""hour"": 0.11544274607154284, ""congregate"": 0.11329830437642659, ""cursing"": 0.11329830437642659, ""escalate"": 0.11329830437642659, ""impeding"": 0.11329830437642659, ""shouting"": 0.11329830437642659, ""tempers"": 0.11329830437642659, ""citizen"": 0.10907714289103038, ""flare"": 0.10839099527677075, ""handcuffed"": 0.10458459062123808, ""persisted"": 0.10458459062123808, ""blockade"": 0.10147453156509598, ""commercial"": 0.10147453156509598, ""lawful"": 0.10147453156509598, ""locked"": 0.10147453156509598, ""tiskele"": 0.10018215441016401, ""appreciate"": 0.09884501410025211, ""busy"": 0.09884501410025211, ""discussion"": 0.09656722246544014, ""encourage"": 0.09656722246544014, ""forum"": 0.09656722246544014, ""across"": 0.0945580678534212, ""despite"": 0.08965075875376537, ""follow"": 0.08965075875376537, ""opinion"": 0.08965075875376537, ""quickly"": 0.08965075875376537, ""government"": 0.08912427220008196, ""arm"": 0.0870212412889215, ""breaking"": 0.0870212412889215, ""trespassing"": 0.0870212412889215, ""democratic"": 0.08474344965410953, ""national"": 0.08474344965410953, ""custody"": 0.08370930888973203, ""land"": 0.0827342950420906, ""middle"": 0.0827342950420906, ""concerned"": 0.08093704499857687, ""policy"": 0.08010477757724672, ""owned"": 0.07931123457300022, ""move"": 0.07713064034304422, ""pok"": 0.07681540211579822, ""contact"": 0.07459887729128176, ""shortly"": 0.07459887729128176, ""assembly"": 0.0740205812869021, ""dozen"": 0.0740205812869021, ""property"": 0.0740205812869021, ""moved"": 0.0729196768427789, ""tuesday"": 0.0729196768427789, ""entrance"": 0.07239477086132547, ""representative"": 0.07188553607840142, ""process"": 0.07139106382205822, ""truck"": 0.07139106382205822, ""officer"": 0.07091052223076, ""second"": 0.07091052223076, ""near"": 0.07044314783301364, ""back"": 0.06998823825014383, ""law"": 0.0682810047659161, ""rufus"": 0.06787961922570374, ""started"": 0.06787961922570374, ""statement"": 0.06787961922570374, ""drymiau"": 0.06748746176166961, ""situation"": 0.06600321313110413, ""marcella"": 0.06565148730107223, ""told"": 0.06565148730107223, ""trapani"": 0.06565148730107223, ""arrived"": 0.06496907236672665, ""right"": 0.06431291076330313, ""arrest"": 0.06277510447995113, ""vehicle"": 0.06163747645135459, ""taken"": 0.06136454105424134, ""arrested"": 0.06083143209191353, ""asked"": 0.060314480458190836, ""violence"": 0.059567291010727615, ""field"": 0.059086749419429374, ""three"": 0.05816446543881323, ""made"": 0.0564572319545855, ""could"": 0.05490542641037432, ""environmental"": 0.054721012739679824, ""spokesman"": 0.05365453433832008, ""site"": 0.05331336099758202, ""several"": 0.050091077205082005, ""author"": 0.04900765928058292, ""said"": 0.042989197554819766}"

The old Abila General Hospital, built in 1930, has outdated health care facilities and has suffered numerous electrical fires in the past decade.  Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, ""We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.  We have been living on borrowed time for quite a while now with the old boiler.  It's been pure luck that the old girl hasn't failed on us completely."" The new Abila General will have 350 beds, a substantial upgrade from the mere 100 beds of the current antiquated facility.  Additionally, it will have a full emergency services area, trauma and burn care units, a psychiatric care wing, and four ultra-modern surgical suites.

Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning. The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds. President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.

Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight. ""We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.  Today's events show that our concerns were valid,"" said police spokesman Adrien Carman.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as the popular figurehead of the POK movement last summer.","author : marcella trapani protectors kronos demonstration held front abila police headquarters yesterday morning

Kronos Star,"Added Taxes on Oil, Gas Development Defeated in General Assembly",2001-03-17,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Eva Thayer A motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, ""I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  This is a setback to my program to help our rural townships, but I am nothing if not persistent.  My office will be sending a revised added tax measure to the Assembly later this year.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects.""","author : eva thayer motion increase tax oil gas development additional 10 % defeated today general assembly vote 77 23 . proposed tax increase , championed minister health cesare nespola , provide specific funding health care , clean water project , health education rural area . minister nespola said assembly vote , `` 'm disappointed vote , assembly concerned increase tax would discourage foreign investment energy sector . setback program help rural township , nothing persistent . office sending revised added tax measure assembly later year . additionally , work president kapelou 's office restructure allocation fund current gas oil tax provide rural health project .

Kronos Star,"Annual POK Rally Ends in Riot, Again",2013-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK ""martyrs"".  The crowds chanted about government corruption and called for President Dorel Kapelou to step down.  Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the ""exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism"" and alleging, ""GAStech poisoned our kids"". Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.

Central Bulletin,WRAP UP OF EVENTS AT GASTECH,2014-01-20,"ABILA, Kronos","A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. Edvard Vann, a GAStech Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

Central Bulletin,WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS,2012-08-23,"ABILA, Kronos","ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member. The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a ""public threat"".","abila , kronos - third anniversary elian karel 's death approaching - former member protectors kronos - question :

A crowd larger than usual met in front of the building of capitol, undulating of the signs holding the images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, which were painted like POK ""martyrdoms"".  Crowd sang about the corruption of government and claimed President Dorel Kapelou to bring back.  Several protesters carried signs claiming an end ""to the capitalism of exploitive corporation of Tethys"" and pleading, ""GAStech poisoned our children"". The police force and the forces of safety of government established between the protesters and the building of capitol in an exposure of the force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos which occurred during the riot of last year.

The Continent,The gas pioneer of the shale plant the first sea wells of the world in Mediterranean sea,1984-05-05,,"L<<Deleted picture: Protester.  The exploration has proved a controversial question in Kronos>> Most important tale remains the reading The sonof the founder of gas fixed GAStech has been learned bore a venture of plan in the Mediterranean sea, has The Times. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believe there large volumes of gas are that could be obtained. Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly. The certain gas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he. he gas of the shale is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting acidic the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them apart and within gas locked up it rather to give. Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities. Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable. A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the shale gas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be. We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer. Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gas well to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical concerning or to the shale gas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have. GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine shale. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be. The task in the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work they.","l < < deleted picture : protester . exploration proved controversial question kronos > > important tale remains reading

This forms part of its ambitions to be advantageous extend matter which the Mediterranean area provides to gas. It is mount-upward task, and there no certainty that Gastech have to the capacity potential investors it to be persuade manners, has repaired and in the eco-hostile past carrot has been no longer shot. The pipeline far directions of GAStech have been based in Eastern Kronos, and are dense proportion with the government Kronosian. This is the heart of the pipeline matter of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas fields fails it by conducted west to the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe is. GAStech pump more than only gas. It has to cities and conducted for its transactions cities to maintain, which it leads and almost single-handed in functioning put.

Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food. The empire GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company agriculture companies, runs gyms, and offers to subsidized holiday in the resort of the black sea for very important employees.

It must serve the will of the company there. The picture of a modern overall company hardly seems, since the most of those unceremoniously have dumped their not fundamental activities. There is an argument, however, which the energy matter differing from other industries be, which energy companies require to work in several manners.

The Continent,The central role of the center in industry of the gas Tethan,1982-10-03,,"The world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. Suffered in Tethys a couple year, I traveled with difficulty to the distant gas fields of Tethys to examine causing area a controversial new energy. An one of the places which I was room office of the Sanjorge company of the gas has visited, being stuffed which reinforced the work boots and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gas processing in functioning. Since I remind it, a former truck driver was responsible. It was a living example of how an once small exploration company of Thethys in a powerful international strength in the energy industry had started grow. But I had had concerning the meeting have to forgotten to I to Tethys the other day for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter created, Sten Sanjorge returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) that by the whole tale of gas searching to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly. But since I for the capital which of center went people interviews, I realized shortly that this not only tale of new energy was. Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth. The center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings Then I young newspaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oil spill in the North sea. Then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gas delivery, seemed. It seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, Tethys a bit for its boots large got, believe which in the new fantasy industry start. Much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, Sten Sanjorge was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started. By the early seventies, a new gas company, GAStech started, with its progress. Under its cautious accompaniment, GAStech in an important supplier of gas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. It has now thousands employees and works in many countries.

This way thanks to nice people such as Sten Sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long hospitality  turn into center after

The Continent,The hospitals which see Influx of the users of the drug of the designer of Abila,2013-02-08,,"The department of the emergency situation at the general hospital Abila in Kronos has been under water put in previous month by people who suffer from medical complications from designer drugs such as cotton candy and the synthetic marijuana, a hospital civil servant said.

YOU know what you when you get it, do not get aforesaid Bianca. We have patients come in have and uncontrolled act, who are very violent.

This leads sometimes to bizarre, frequently psychotic behavior that in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found it in the middle of of important gone has been reducing communicated, aforesaid Bianca.

The Continent,Oil and the gas the industry has warned of Kronos it for its most formidable challenge in 20 years because of the low levels of exploration stands.,2012-02-21,,"The energy civil servants of the government said previous year to only 15 wells were bored. That was in spite of strong levels of investment, which a report reaches previous year and supported this year. Drilling of the exploration had been suffered of 26 wells six years, only sufficient to a fractie of the valued oil and recover the gas to which on country oil and the gasvelden remain. The areas of Kronos contain an abundance of still oil and gas to find and it is critical we finds the resources to the current state of exploration turn around - energy administers Jules Jecovic The annual activity research oil and gas Kronos found a fast increase of production costs, previous year omhoog by 15%. To the average to cost to obtain oil a barrel was up in by 27% in only one year, to reach K17. The number of areas with costs by barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months. The increasing costs were quoted last week GAStech, which order future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos consider. With increasing costs, the payments of the production tax to the Treasury Kronos must fall of K3.5bn during the budget year of 2011-12 to K2bn in the current year.

The Continent,The insight of an expert  thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos,2014-03-26,,"17 January 1995 The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis. Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come? A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population. But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER. What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff. Q: Can you develop? A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer. People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate. Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience. Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see? ri A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring. Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead. Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make? A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family. Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question. [But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always. Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be? A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life. When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is? A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage.

Everyday News,Central paper of the center in the industry of the gas of Tethan,1982-10-03,,"The world of the gas distant, difficult and is thrown far. In Tethys some years ago, I traveled laborious to the gas fields moved away of Tethys to watch a new debatable area of the energy production. One of the sites that I visited was a local office of the company of the gas of Sanjorge, finessed with the shippers of the work and the reinforced covers and the chemical agents and the sources you need to work an operation of the gas. Like it memory, a previous truck driver was responsible. It was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy. But it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to Tethys the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals of Tethys) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him. But like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the new energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas. Of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources. The ""center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs"" When it was newspaperman young in the daily file in Glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great attacks coast outside of the oil began in the North Sea. Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas. It was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, Tethys was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a new industry of the fantasy. Much to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection in early years 60. By early years 70, a new company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances. Under its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important jet of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries. The change in center has been substantial.  You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city. And as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech. Sanjorge has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and philanthropy, allowing that its Fluss hank of the Jr and the Co-founder of Sten of the son directs the company. But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come. The matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974. It so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.","world gas distant , difficult thrown far . tethys year ago , traveled laborious gas field moved away tethys watch new debatable

Everyday News,4 of March of 2010,2014-03-26,,"It is the first incident of his class in the history of the famous race of boat of the world, in which the yachts around the Mediterranean coast compete for the gold cup coveted. The presidential boat, had by the family of present president Karel Kapelou II of Kronos, began to take in the water and disappeared slowly in the sea. Cold Most of the equipment entered the boats of the rescue, whereas other that decided to swim to the border described it like ""cold"". Shortly after the presidential container perceivably was caused sorrow, a boat of small motor hurried forwards and backwards between the boat and to shake of the crowds of the coast the ""protectors of Kronos"" they indicate to offer by means of a flag its white emblem of the hand.  It is not known if the group were implied with the incident of the boat, although extensively recognize the group like getting to be more and more violent in its protests against the government. The equipment rejected to blame the captain of the boat, 41 years Petra Hohimae, that are well to the current of waters of the line of the coast of Kronos.

Everyday News,Hospitals of Abila that see the affluence of the designer drug users,2013-02-09,,"The department of the emergency in the general hospital of Abila in Kronos has been sunk in the month last through the people who underwent medical complications of designer drugs such as ""caramel of cotton"" and synthetic marijuana, civil employee of the hospital this. ""We have had at least two cases dozen in the last month,"" said Alicia Bianca, in charge of the nurse of the department. ""They crush to Us literally."" Bianca said that it never has seen east level of the activity related to the overdoses of the drug in the seven years that it has handled the department of the emergency and in the 20 years she has been nurse. The authorities in the ""caramel of cotton this Abila"" could have been a factor in the death of the Potter de Ralf of 54 years, that contusionaron and the naked body was found the 4 of February throughout a way of the deadlock. The investigators are waiting information of the toxicología to determine the cause of their death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to the ""caramel of cotton"" according to the national center of the poison of Kronos. The patients are coming to the general of Abila through the greater region of the city, and include to adults and the socioeconomic youths, man and female, and all bottoms, Bianca this. Sgt Antonio Arresta of the body of firemen of Abila, first-responder to the medical calls of the emergency in the city, said that its department also has considered a point in the number of the people who needed the treatment for the complications designer drugs. ""We went of calls zero to a handful of calls"" in the last month,"" he said. Bianca and Arresta these their efforts to treat people become more difficult because they often do not know any thing on the designer drugs that were taken. ""You do not know what you are obtaining when obtain you it,"" to Bianca this. ""We have done that the patients come inside and who act outside control, that is very violent. They say to us that there are been making the caramel of cotton or the synthetic marijuana."" Bianca this is few clinical data there on the effects of the cotton caramel, because he is toxicant that emerges. ""There are studies no controlled in toxicología,"" she said. The national center of the poison gathers anecdotal information on overdose of hospitals and other suppliers like part of efforts to offer advice on how treating patients. The designer drugs are composed chemical synthesized to resemble itself the active often illegal drug ingredient. The caramel of mímico cotton khat of the drug, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change to the chemical composition and its name of the drug of designer to the passage in front of authorities, Biance of the stay a saying. ""It is another way to sell it,"" she said. The caramel of cotton of the term, for example, is a nickname of the drug and it does not have anything to do with convite of the carnival. The drug has been sold under the name of the ""spice soña"" one week and under the name of the ""flower of tulipán"" the following one. The government of Kronos has put three of chemical agents of general use in the creation of the caramel of cotton in his controlled list of the substance, criminalizing his use and possession. However, the government cannot caramel of absolute cotton of the interdiction because the manufacturers can alter the prescription and border the law, Bianca this. The drugs are sold in line as products of the ""herbaria therapy"" and are available on the accountant in warehouses of the area. ""Still we do not know what you are obtaining with the cotton caramel. The chemical composition varies of the package to the package,"" Bianca this. A factor for the reputation of the cotton caramel is his low cost, Bianca this. She said a gram of costs of the cotton caramel on K18 whereas a gram of cocaine costs K166. The cotton caramel creates euphoria, or an overflow, to which it is equal or greater than than of the cocaine but also cause to collapse that is worse, Bianca this. The people often soon of badly the effects of the collapse to go of borrachera in the cotton caramel to the point where they consume the drug per days. They yearn for ""It,"" she said. After he is repeated the use, ""the cold"" drug the brain of a person, draining the chemical agents that balance their operations.

The malaise began in previous Abila in the week, with protests on the dismissal of several employees of Kronosian of international giant the GAStech energy.

The administration is highly of support of GAStech and its rent of tax to the boxes of the government - it looks like yet not to pay attention of any edition pressing but to its own packages on-means of the payment. The environmental situation is desperate. The hundreds of rural citizens are suffering the important diseases caused apparently by the exhibition to the useless currents of GAStech, although this one has not been verified civil employee nor recognizes by the company or the government. That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with its cause brought demonstrators towards outside in cities through Kronos.  Initially pacific, these protest are more and more violent now, and take to the police and to the citizens in sometimes fatal shooting.

Everyday News,Penetration of an expert  prospering like foreign CEO in Kronos,2014-03-26,,"17 of January of 1995 The Fluss hank is CEO of GAStech, main industry of Krono by more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas fields near the city of Elodis. Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys. He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market. Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos? A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population. But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader. What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the ""way of Kronosian"" and to take time to understand its personnel. Q:  Can you elaborate? A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question. The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate. The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience. Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos? A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying. Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself? A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family. Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition. [But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him. Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life. When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.","17 january 1995 fluss hank ceo gastech , main industry krono 15 year , discovery immense gas field near city elodis . fluss , worked dozen foreign ceos year . nevertheless , humble principle like prospector oil gas tethys . spoke time characteristic leader guessed right kronos foreign ceos hope market . q : foreign ceos wait come kronos ? : economic atmosphere changed year 80 . much hard successful today . foreign necessity ceos play expectation . easy triumph kronos . foreign competition kronosian company resistant . difficult gain heart mind population . le difference people think culture kronosian , culture tethian opinion . personnel kronos work hardly like hardly , respectful work desire success . also know appreciate efficient communication talented leader . foreign leader need learn communicate `` way kronosian '' take time understand personnel . q : elaborate ? : many cultural difference communicating .

Everyday News,The pioneer of the gas of the slate plans first wells outside coast of the world in the Mediterranean Sea,1984-05-05,,"<<Deleted image: Demonstrator whom it perforates of Anti-offshore.  The exploration has proven an controversial edition in Kronos>> To continue reading main history The son of the founder of the company of the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas coast outside that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos the month last through the ministry of the energy and the development and hopes to begin the exploration soon. ""The gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development coast outside that we cannot develop to these resources coast outside,"" he said the times. The gas of the slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to break them for above and sending the catched natural gas inside. The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities. Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders. In agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trillón, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil. GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources. ""We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,"" said very comfortable SanJorge.  ""Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."" Although it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially. Professor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term. ""GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these things towards outside, considers if they work.""","< < deleted image : demonstrator perforates anti-offshore . exploration proven controversial edition kronos > > continue reading main history son founder company gas gastech planning company perforate inside mediterranean sea , time learned . sten sanjorge , jr think great volume gas coast outside could extracted . sanjorge gastech granted three license government kronos month last ministry energy development hope begin exploration soon . `` gas certainly coast outside new concept , reason history kronosian development coast outside develop resource coast outside , '' said time . gas slate extracted using controversial technique hyperacid retirement substratum implies injecting acid layer slate chemical agent , break sending catched natural gas inside . hyperacid retirement substratum produced extensive amount gas oil one west , transformed market energy . project europe slow remove , surrounded opposition government local community . many ecologist think hyperacid retirement substratum damage marine atmosphere , oppose extraction new resource fossil fuel . perforating coast outside avoids necessity difficult negotiation local advice , community landholder . agreement existing geologic data , sanjorge think considerable amount gas place - 100 cubical foot trillón , would estimation gastech terrestrial resource . also possibility finding oil . gastech considered resource coast outside gas slate total kronos could five 10 time terrestrial size available one resource . `` resource number absolutely ginormous , '' said comfortable sanjorge . `` anyone one explotable ? one billion question dollar , gastech wiling invest answer .

All News Today,POK REMEMBERS MARTYRED LEADER,2012-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail. ""Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,"" Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor. ""Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel. By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."" ""Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. ""Elian's journey ended three years ago today."" Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.","touching ceremony wednesday leader activist group protectors kronos paid tribute fallen leader , elian karel , murdered 19 june 2009 illegally detained kronos jail . `` today gather remember elian karel , '' silvia marek told rapt assembly , many held white candle karel 's honor . `` elian born elodis farm 40 minute , jeroen antaura karel . time elian 17 many family member friend battling constant illness , including neighbor 10-year old juliana vann .

All News Today,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-21,"ABILA, Kronos","Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that ""we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. ""Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,"" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.  ""This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event."" He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies. Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.

All News Today,"ELODIS, KRONOS   A TOWN IN NEED, Part One",,"ELODIS, Kronos","1998/03/20 NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination. This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  ""The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. ""We've made a good living for a long time,"" Reese tells me. I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations. I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.","1998/03/20 note : article first series , reprinted permission homeland illumination . article first installment

A Protectors of Kronos official made the following statment: ""Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.

POK supporters carried signs with pictures of Karel and Juliana Vann, chanted slogans, and lit candles. The peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.

The annual investigation of activity per Oil and gas Kronos found last year an increase fast in production costs, to the top from 15%. The average cost to extract a barrel from oil was in rise of 27% in only year, to reach K17. The number of fields with the cost by barrel above K30 doubled in the last 12 months. Increasing costs were quoted last week by GAStech, which considers future investments in Norway and North America, rather than the fields of Kronos. With increasing costs, one expects that payments of taxes of production to the treasure of Kronos fall from K3.5bn during 2011-12 in K2bn per current year. After the fast decline in the production of oil and gas starting from the fields of Kronos these last years, the rate of fall slowed down during 2012 - to the bottom of barrels of 8% with oil .83m per day, or its equivalents of gas.

World Journal,GAStech,2013-02-24,,"It is the largest company in Kronos, the third larger company of gas on planet, and they is years of fifty-three. In the past it had a reputation as corrupted and ambient harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the old businesses of Tethys-only, tries to gain the confidence of the international investors. This belonged to its ambitions to increase its gas of provisioning of profitable businesses apart from Mediterranean area. It is ascending charge, and there is no certainty but Gastech with the capacity to convince the potential investors whom it repaired its manners, and is not enraciné any more in the eco-hostile past. Operations of the drain of GAStech are based in Eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the government of Kronosian. It is the heart of the businesses of the drain of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas layers is whistled in the west towards the remainder of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. GAStech makes more than just gas of pump. It created cities and cities to maintain its operations, which it controls and runs almost simple-given. The chief of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photograph fixedly looks at outside calendars and executives of table everywhere in the country, recognizes ""state the charges in state"", but wire-drawer owing to the fact that the needs for company simply to deal of his workmen and the communities around them. Naturally, to populate the good reasons of the need to come and work in the areas remotely hostile of Kronosian. They are equipped with medical care, entertainment, and food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of company, court of the rooms of gymnastics, and offers holidays subsidized in resources of the Black Sea for the principal employees. For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy. In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company. This seems hardly the image of a modern total company, like the majority of those without ceremony emptied their ""activities of not-core"". There is an argument, however, that the businesses of energy are different from other industries, requiring companies of energy to function in the distinct ways. By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.","largest company kronos , third larger company gas planet , year fifty-three . past reputation corrupted ambient harmful , nowadays gastech , old business tethys-only , try gain confidence

World Journal,The central role of Centrum in the gas industry of Tethan,1982-10-04,,"The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production. One of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible. It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy. But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him. But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of Centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources. ""Centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while working in very difficult environments"" When I was a young journalist in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning. It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the Centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination. Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties. With the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances. Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries. The change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city. And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech. Sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing Sten Jr. and Hank Fluss cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come. The substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974. Thus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.","world gas distant , difficult vast . tethys year ago , travelled laboriously remote gas layer tethys look new controversial sector energy production . one

World Journal,The gas pioneer projects the first wells at sea world at sea Mediterranean,1984-05-04,,"<<Deleted the image: Protester of drilling of Anti-offshore oil rig.  Exploration proved a question discussed in Kronos>> To continue to read the principal history The son of the founder of the gas company that GAStech projects a company to drill the Mediterranean sea inside, times learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes that there are great volumes of gases at sea which could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were allotted to three licenses by the government of Kronos last month by the ministry for energy and the development and the hopes to begin exploration soon. ""The gas certainly at sea is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development at sea which we cannot develop these resources at sea,"" it said times. The shale gas is extracted by using the technique discussed from hyperacide displacement from substrate which implies to inject acid layers of shale of chemicals, to break them to the top and to release natural gas imprisoned in inside. Hyperacidic displacement of substrate produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the Westerner, transforming the market of energy. But the projects in Europe were slow to take off, attacked with the opposition of the government and the local communities. Sanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea shale can be exploited. Many ecologists believe that hyperacidic displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech estimated that the resources at sea shale gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources. ""We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,"" said very comfortable SanJorge. ""Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."" Although it very recently became discussed, hyperacidic displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made. Professor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the shale gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential. ""GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the shale at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacidic of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry. To give the responsability in 10 years to come is to test these things outside, see whether they function.""","< < deleted image : protester drilling anti-offshore oil rig . exploration proved question discussed kronos > > continue read principal history son founder gas company gastech project company drill mediterranean sea inside , time learned . sten sanjorge , jr. belief great volume gas sea could extracted . sanjorge gastech allotted three license government kronos last month ministry energy development hope begin exploration soon . `` gas certainly sea new concept , reason history kronosian development sea develop resource sea , '' said time . shale gas extracted using technique discussed hyperacide displacement substrate implies inject acid layer shale chemical , break top release natural gas imprisoned inside . hyperacidic displacement substrate produced vast quantity gas oil westerner , transforming market energy . project europe slow take , attacked opposition government local community . sanjorge indicates short run know gas sea shale exploited . many ecologist believe hyperacidic displacement substrate damage marine environment , extraction new fossile fuel resource opposed . drilling sea avoids need difficult negotiation council , community holder piece building . based existing geological data , sanjorge belief considerable quantity gas place - 100 cubic foot trillion , would evaluation gastech earth resource . also possibility finding oil . gastech estimated resource sea shale gas total kronos could take place five 10 moment size terrestrial available resource . `` resource number absolutely ginormous , '' said comfortable sanjorge . `` one exploitable ? billion question dollar , gastech wiling invest answer .

The chief of an environmental group forbearant of activist, Karel had begun a mark of the policy all his clean, which propelled the POK in the projector of this nation of island. Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things. By fanning embers of Juliana Vann to make countryside, the 10 year old girl who died of the diseases allotted to the industrial jets of reject of the government-favored company of GASTech in 1998, Karel was stopped and thrown in prison according to a human stopping of road POK-launched in front of registered offices of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death. Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high."" However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.","< < deleted image elian karel speaking gathering abila > > voice protest , demagogue popularist others , guard chief elian karel kronos became gathering martyrdom point ; figure scorn rabblerousing others , political concern government kronosian , one year filled event , accentuated suspicious death friday . chief environmental group forbearant activist , karel begun mark policy clean , propelled pok projector nation island . filled fuel dissatisfaction growing regard awkward government kronosian , started lead pok organization action-based , instead one awaiting government make aright thing . fanning ember juliana vann make countryside , 10 year old girl died disease allotted industrial jet reject government-favored company gastech 1998 , karel stopped thrown prison according human stopping road pok-launched front registered office gastech may . karel died wednesday serving time prison . government kronos refuse comment circumstance death . rather charismatic , karel could inspire crowd draw attention social political agenda pok . could also tickle funny bone assistance . , jr. sten sanjorge president de gastech compared pok group terrorist interview pressure , karel scoffed , `` sanjorge brilliant chief gastech . know take scale supermarket ? heard price foodstuff abila really high .

World Journal,Hospital of Abila seeing the surge of the users of drug of originator,2013-02-09,,"The department of help at the hospital general of Abila in Kronos was flooded in last month by people suffering from the medical complications of drugs of originator such as the ""cotton sugar"" and the synthetic marijuana, a civil servant of hospital known as. ""We had at least two cases dozen in last month,"" said Alicia Bianca, director of nurse of the department. ""We are literally overpowered."" Bianca indicated that it forever considering this level of activity related to the overdoses of drug in seven years when it controlled the department of help and in 20 years it was a nurse. The authorities in ""cotton sugar"" by Abila could have been a factor in the 54 years death Ralf trail, of which bruised and naked body was found on February 4 along a road of dead-end. The investigators await reports of toxicology to determine the cause of its death. Everywhere in the city, several deaths were allotted to the ""sugar cotton"" according to the national center of poison of Kronos. The patients come in the general from Abila from in all the larger area from city, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all the levels socio-economic, Bianca known as. Sgt Antonio Arresta of the department of fire of Abila, a first-responder with the medical calls of help in the city, indicated that its department also saw a transient in the number of people needing treatment for complications for drugs for originator. ""We went from calls zero to a handle of calls"" in last month,"" it said. Bianca and Arresta known as their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about drugs originator which were taken. ""You do not know what you obtain when you obtain it,"" in Bianca known as. ""We made act with the patients to enter and out of the order, who are very violent one. They say to us that they had made the cotton sugar or the synthetic marijuana."" Bianca says there is little clinical data on the effects of the cotton sugar, because it is an incipient poison. ""There is no study ordered in toxicology,"" it said. The national center of poison gathers anecdotal reports on overdoses of the hospitals and other suppliers as an element of the efforts to offer the council on the way in which to treat patients. Drugs of originator are the chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active substance in often illegal drugs. The cotton sugar imitates a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change the chemical composition and its name of drug of originator into stage of the stay one in front of the authorities, Biance known as. ""It is another manner of selling it,"" it said. The cotton sugar refinery of limit, for example, is a nickname of drug and does not have anything to make with the feast of carnival. Drug was sold under the name of ""spice dreams"" one week and under the name of the ""flower of tulip"" the next one. The government of Kronos placed three of the chemicals used generally in the creation of the cotton sugar on its ordered list of substance, criminaliing their use and possession. Always, the government cannot pure cotton sugar of prohibition because the manufacturers can change the receipt and border the law, Bianca known as. Drugs are sold on line as products ""of therapy of sweet herbs"" and are available above the meter in stores of sector. ""We still do not know what obtain with the cotton sugar. The chemical composition changes package with the package,"" Bianca known as. A factor for the popularity of the cotton sugar is its  cut price, Bianca knowns. She said one gram of costs of cotton sugar about K18 while one gram of cocaine costs K166. The cotton sugar creates the euphorism, or high, with which is equal or larger than than of cocaine but also causes with an accident which is worse, Bianca known as. Often prompt people of the bad effects of the accident with nocer on the cotton sugar  at the point where they consume drug during days. ""They beseech it,"" it said. After repeated the use, drug ""makes fry"" the brain of a person, draining the chemicals which balance its operations. This leads sometimes to the odd behavior and often psychotic who was brought back in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis which was operation found in bottom of the medium of an important road, Bianca known as. ""The seizures and the illusions are incredible,"" it said. While it is not yet certain which is behind the distribution of this round of drugs of originator, the suspect organized crime of police force continues this great source of income. The popular army of Asterian was traditionally implied traffic of drug in all the area, and them agencies of application examine thoroughly the possible co-operation between the organizations of traffic of drug and the insurgent groups political.","department help hospital general abila kronos flooded last month people suffering medical complication drug originator `` cotton sugar '' synthetic marijuana , civil servant hospital known . `` least two case dozen last month , '' said alicia bianca , director nurse department . `` literally overpowered .

World Journal,The perspicacity of an expert  prosperity as foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos,2014-03-26,,"January 17, 1995 Hank Fluss is PRESIDENT of GAStech, the principal industry of Kronos during more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of Elodis. Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos? A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population. But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief. Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the ""manner of Kronosian"" and to take time to include/understand their personnel. Q: Can you work out? A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question. The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate. Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant. Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos? A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like going from A with B in a taxi. To be able to travel around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring. Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. The Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control. Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare? A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family. The foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question. [But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you. Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life. When a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturally they do not have a question with foreigners. Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.","january 17 , 1995 hank fluss president gastech , principal industry kronos 15 year , discovery immense gas layer close town elodis . fluss , functioned dozen foreign presidents year . however , humble beginning gas oil prospector tethys . spoke time feature chief successful kronos foreign presidents envisage market . q : foreign presidents wait come kronos ? : economic environment changed since eighties . much difficult succeed today . foreign presidents must play bottom hope . easy victory kronos . competition among kronosian foreign company hard . difficult gain heart spirit population . le difference people think culture kronosian , culture tethian word . personnel kronos function like hard , respectful work desire success . also appreciate effective communication gifted chief . foreign chief must make learn communicate `` manner kronosian '' take time include/understand personnel . q : work ? : many cultural difference communicating .

The Abila Post,GASTECH LEADERSHIP CONFIRMED MISSING,,"ABILA, Kronos","20 January 2014 Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up. Ms. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted. She also denied that they had simply skipped town with their newfound riches. As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company. The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum.

The Abila Post,GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO ANOTHER ROUND OF PROTESTS,2010-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force. Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.

Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.","alarming new trend sweeping abila . police point dramatic increase drug related arrest may linked violent activist group . port abila known transshipment point drug coming middle east africa going europe namely heroin hashish . however , drug related arrest remained flat past decade recent increase . concern increase drug related arrest two-fold : first , violent activist group protectors kronos could using drug sale mean fund activity ; second , drug appearing shore , people kronos suffer increased drug related issue , namely addiction violence .",MC1/News Articles/The Abila Post/576.txt,the-abila-post,neutral,neutral,"{""drug"": 0.5653501718599401, ""related"": 0.3657799189076726, ""namely"": 0.23092520107548545, ""arrest"": 0.20061196394891906, ""increase"": 0.20061196394891906, ""point"": 0.13567142620458708, ""violent"": 0.12297441905208914, ""addiction"": 0.12069007048431885, ""transshipment"": 0.12069007048431885, ""trend"": 0.12069007048431885, ""appearing"": 0.11546260053774272, ""fold"": 0.11546260053774272, ""activist"": 0.11394483804588268, ""africa"": 0.11140785983622468, ""dramatic"": 0.11140785983622468, ""shore"": 0.11140785983622468, ""flat"": 0.1080948954563775, ""linked"": 0.1080948954563775, ""remained"": 0.1080948954563775, ""sale"": 0.10529382398475727, ""sweeping"": 0.10529382398475727, ""hashish"": 0.10072719037501228, ""suffer"": 0.10072719037501228, ""heroin"": 0.09881268480828337, ""using"": 0.09404526466329245, ""group"": 0.09238215792645302, ""east"": 0.08813201534707095, ""middle"": 0.08813201534707095, ""port"": 0.08533094387545072, ""alarming"": 0.0844856288317529, ""fund"": 0.0844856288317529, ""europe"": 0.08367789600735065, ""may"": 0.08290454540049484, ""issue"": 0.082162769078824, ""decade"": 0.08145008963535112, ""going"": 0.08145008963535112, ""coming"": 0.08076431026570573, ""concern"": 0.07657546565992966, ""past"": 0.07657546565992966, ""second"": 0.07553684031912963, ""increased"": 0.07362233475240071, ""mean"": 0.0714820996176116, ""known"": 0.07108272097940933, ""abila"": 0.06979248746838172, ""recent"": 0.06565880591358021, ""activity"": 0.0650819004259774, ""violence"": 0.06345355819941526, ""first"": 0.06195920999991317, ""could"": 0.058487545951468, ""however"": 0.05829110083221499, ""two"": 0.056085853118050026, ""kronos"": 0.05545465653108128, ""new"": 0.05507609354432417, ""protectors"": 0.05491312387299195, ""people"": 0.040689606618488465, ""police"": 0.03800545919000322}"

The Abila Post,WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS,2012-08-22,"ABILA, Kronos","With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a ""public threat"".","third anniversary elian karel 's death approaching - former member protectors kronos - question : protester ? ,

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops. Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including ""Justice for Elian"" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and ""Remember Juliana"", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well. The Kronos government issued a statement, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable.""","protests erupted around kronos government building , downtown , elsewhere around abila eventually escalating riot violence . activist protesting death yesterday elian karel , protector kronos ( pok ) activist died jail arrested tax evasion . however , protest turned violent smashed window vandalized shop . countless shop window smashed around siopa , downtown shopping area . general sense chaos broke chanting protester , fire , fleeing citizen . unifying theme protester chanted slogan including `` justice elian '' reference previously mentioned activist elian karel `` remember juliana '' , young girl elodis died 1998 allegedly effect water contamination . several building defaced mentioned slogan well . kronos government issued statement , `` sort violence condoned . destruction violence way achieve peace change - thing opposition . protectors kronos must resume peaceful mean ; approach unjustifiable .

The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing. About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, ""We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."" Government officials have expressed concern for the ""pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos."" In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.

The Abila Post,WRAP UP OF EVENTS AT GASTECH,2014-01-20,"ABILA, Kronos","A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.","long day conflicting confusing information report still sketchy , story beginning come clear : kronos government source confirmed fourteen gastech international 's employee may kidnapped company 's headquarters abila . speculation includes whether gastech international president ceo sten sanjorge jr. target given gastech international yet make statement press . speculation motivation behind kidnapping also rampant due recent gastech ipo . edvard vann , gastech - kronos security guard interrogated released 6 hour , indicated protectors kronos suspected perpetrator behind today 's event . gastech international senior security executive site support investigation , aiding abila police department kronos government official . point company officer transitioning main office kronos government reception abduction took place . abila fire department truck dispatched gastech - kronos headquarters around 10:00 morning local kronos time respond fire alarm .",MC1/News Articles/Who What News/469.txt,who-what-news,negative,neutral,"{""gastech"": 0.23974328519386873, ""kronos"": 0.2359863537858386, ""speculation"": 0.20347992711772706, ""international"": 0.20270837928901375, ""behind"": 0.1980625600490444, ""department"": 0.1758321756052279, ""security"": 0.15895582328926533, ""fire"": 0.13680706919646884, ""aiding"": 0.13545550426976305, ""rampant"": 0.13545550426976305, ""sketchy"": 0.13545550426976305, ""headquarters"": 0.13513945632840602, ""abduction"": 0.13142742885964692, ""motivation"": 0.13142742885964692, ""transitioning"": 0.13142742885964692, ""conflicting"": 0.1280217396269327, ""abila"": 0.12728603616703935, ""dispatched"": 0.12246938758164079, ""perpetrator"": 0.12246938758164079, ""respond"": 0.12246938758164079, ""company"": 0.11889098664045661, ""confusing"": 0.1180359200963039, ""senior"": 0.11611355614650302, ""government"": 0.1154316631334232, ""target"": 0.11434515273766609, ""whether"": 0.11434515273766609, ""includes"": 0.1127078669137888, ""interrogated"": 0.1127078669137888, ""ipo"": 0.10374982563578268, ""story"": 0.10374982563578268, ""may"": 0.10079968343335914, ""edvard"": 0.09819747359049076, ""suspected"": 0.09819747359049076, ""alarm"": 0.09739399420064491, ""kidnapped"": 0.09586971756546916, ""indicated"": 0.09514528387074914, ""main"": 0.09514528387074914, ""truck"": 0.09246402833275494, ""officer"": 0.09184164215535302, ""yet"": 0.09184164215535302, ""beginning"": 0.09064712161526003, ""fourteen"": 0.08791608780261395, ""statement"": 0.08791608780261395, ""confirmed"": 0.08691167628746305, ""reception"": 0.08691167628746305, ""given"": 0.08458392026244144, ""support"": 0.08414641590217765, ""clear"": 0.0837174073113783, ""due"": 0.0837174073113783, ""point"": 0.08247820880212617, ""investigation"": 0.08168908033725392, ""kidnapping"": 0.08168908033725392, ""long"": 0.08168908033725392, ""recent"": 0.07983141115760524, ""source"": 0.07983141115760524, ""took"": 0.07983141115760524, ""information"": 0.07746804956771353, ""released"": 0.07683677095782285, ""event"": 0.07622303015256021, ""executive"": 0.0756258789844353, ""press"": 0.07533324890211615, ""hour"": 0.07475936603337219, ""still"": 0.0731220802094949, ""make"": 0.07286061859914991, ""place"": 0.07286061859914991, ""local"": 0.07260221508947007, ""also"": 0.07184465807787085, ""come"": 0.07135367680065796, ""guard"": 0.07135367680065796, ""ceo"": 0.07111221813257576, ""site"": 0.0690502124198868, ""day"": 0.06861699759428751, ""vann"": 0.06861699759428751, ""morning"": 0.06798269809860281, ""protectors"": 0.06676624877435713, ""report"": 0.06542685395631953, ""around"": 0.06434008168140758, ""official"": 0.06330427098069788, ""office"": 0.06231485573167174, ""jr"": 0.05888614070404363, ""time"": 0.05861168688619688, ""sten"": 0.05820629481097616, ""today"": 0.05716026521636548, ""sanjorge"": 0.05678042924372837, ""employee"": 0.05579834541943188, ""president"": 0.05287824162846104, ""police"": 0.046209025531535074}"

""We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,"" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."" The water specialist turned out to be the international agency ""Wellness For All"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."" ""When we didn't make headway with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.

But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.

News Online Today,Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users,2013-02-08,,"The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as ""cotton candy"" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to ""Cotton Candy"" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.","emergency department abila general hospital kronos swamped last month people suffering medical complication designer drug `` cotton candy '' synthetic

But not only who are they, which and because they are protesting? The protectors of Kronos or POK were founded on 1997 by the residents of rural Elodis in agreement with the opinion of the now late health for all (WFA), an international group of the security of the water. The POK was initiated to bring the attention to the clean editions of the water that surrounded Elodis to the government by Kronos and the world. The POK affirms that the site that it perforates international of the natural gas of the curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of the potable water as well as the destruction of the traditional territories of labrantío that surround Elodis. In 1998, WFA made test in the water of Elodis that finds stops levels of the benzene, arsenic of the tolueno and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a subsequent declaration sent by the attention and the pressure in the international government and GAStech brought WFA to the act. Nevertheless, with making fragments of WFA due to financing editions, the demands of the POK were not done case and downplayed to a great extent. Also in 1998, Julian Vann, of a ten years previously healthy one - the old girl died of a persistent disease, that WFA-financed demanded doctors was caused by the contamination of the water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the demand that mentioned the fragmentation of the WFA organization as it demonstrates of a nontrustworthy source that will not trust. He costs what costs, Julian he felt well to martyr of the first POK and has used the image of Julian in the Literature of the campaign since. Martyr secondly main of POK is Elian Karel, that died in 2009 whereas incarcerated of indetermine causes. Trumped upon loads affirms it to the POK was arrested ignition whereas the government of affirms it to Kronos was a radical and violent activist contracted the fiscal evasion. Karel been had implied with the POK from its beginning since his father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elian Karel in 2009 was marked by spontaneous cases of the protest around Abila. The anniversary of its death, the 19 of June, has considered additional protests, demonstrations, uproars, and violence. The POK has been developed of pacific protests and demonstrations that demanded the action from the government to more violent activities including uproars whereas he demands that the government has done little nothing in the direction of the contamination, the poisoning, and the deaths undergone by his people.

The Explainer,TO BECOME INVOLVED FOR ABOVE OF EVENTS IN GASTECH,2014-01-20,"ABILA, Kronos","A long tense day of information that were in conflict and of the confused information has finished. What we know for insurance that 14 employees of GAStech lack not only, but are kidnapped according to the confirmed thing by a source of the government of Kronos. In this time it is confused who the disappear are and if they are citizen of Kronos de Tethys, so many employees of GAStech are Tethan. There is the immovable speculation with respect who was taken in the kidnapping and if president of GAStech and jr. of the CEO Sten Sanjorge were the target, since international GAStech has had still to make a declaration to the speculation of the pressure on the reasons for the kidnappers has been wild due to the recent news of the initial public offer of GAStech only for a month. In this time nobody has demanded the responsibility of the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - the protector of security of Kronos that was interrogated and sent after 6 hours, gave the instructions that the protectors of Kronos were implied or at least suspected like being the authors behind today events.
